AB  - Existing law requires the Attorney General, upon receipt of the text of a proposed initiative or referendum measure, to prepare a circulating title and summary of the chief purposes and points of the proposed measure that includes an estimate of the financial impact of the proposed measure. Existing law requires the Attorney General to prepare a ballot title and summary for each measure that the Secretary of State determines will appear on the ballot at a statewide election.
This bill would instead require the Legislative Analyst to carry out these responsibilities. The bill would make the operation of this requirement contingent upon approval by the voters of SCA ___ of the 2025â€“26 Regular Session.
