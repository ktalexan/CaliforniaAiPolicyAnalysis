        digest = "(1) Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program (Cal Grant Program), establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement Awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B Awards, the Cal Grant C Awards, and the Cal Grant T Awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. Existing law provides that a qualifying institution with a graduation rate of 30% or less for students taking 150% or less of the expected time to complete degree requirements is ineligible for initial and renewal Cal Grant awards, unless the institution has a 3-year cohort default rate that is less than 10% and a graduation rate above 20% for students taking 150% or less of the expected time to complete degree requirements. Existing law sets the maximum Cal Grant A and B awards for new recipients attending private nonprofit postsecondary education institutions at $8,056 for the 2014–15 award year and each award year thereafter.
    This bill would specify eligibility criteria that, commencing with the 2014–15 academic year, would apply to Cal Grant award recipients who were determined to be ineligible for a renewal award because they exceeded the maximum household income or asset level, or failed to meet the minimum need threshold, as specified, but who subsequently meet eligibility requirements for a Cal Grant award. The bill would also increase from 10% to 15.5% the maximum allowable 3-year cohort default rate for an institution with a 20% to 30% graduation rate for students taking no more than 150% of the expected time to complete degree requirements to be eligible for Cal Grant awards. The bill would increase the maximum Cal Grant A and B awards for new recipients attending a private nonprofit postsecondary institution, for the 2014–15 award year only, to $9,084.
    (2) Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission as the primary state agency for the administration of state-authorized student financial aid programs available to students attending all segments of postsecondary education. Existing law establishes the Middle Class Scholarship Program under the administration of the Student Aid Commission. The program provides that, subject to an available and sufficient appropriation, commencing with the 2014–15 academic year, an undergraduate student enrolled at the University of California or the California State University is eligible for a scholarship award that, combined with other publicly funded student financial aid, is up to 40% of the amount charged to that student for mandatory systemwide tuition in that fiscal year if the student meets the following conditions: has an annual household income that does not exceed $150,000; satisfies specified requirements for a Cal Grant award; is a resident of this state or exempt from paying nonresident tuition; files specified financial aid forms; makes timely application or applications for publicly funded student financial aid, as defined, for which he or she is eligible; and maintains at least a 2.0 grade point average.
    This bill would, among other things, specify that the scholarship award under the Middle Class Scholarship Program, combined with other federal, state, and institutionally administered grants and fee waivers, would be for up to 40% of the systemwide tuition and fees. The bill would require a recipient to be enrolled at least part-time, and would require the recipient to be pursuing his or her first undergraduate baccalaureate degree, unless he or she is enrolled in a specified professional teacher preparation program. The bill would also provide that minimum scholarship amount for any full-time student who qualifies for a scholarship award of $1 is $90, and would prohibit discrimination against part-time students in the selection of award recipients.
    (3) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law authorizes the establishment of community college districts under the administration of community college governing boards, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction at community college campuses throughout the state. Existing law requires the governing board of each community college district to prepare and submit to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges a plan for capital construction for community college purposes of the district, as specified. Existing law requires a 5-year plan for capital construction to set out the estimated capital construction needs of the district with reference to specified elements, including enrollment projections for each community college district, formulated by the Department of Finance with the cooperation of each community college district.
    This bill would make reference to certain of these specified elements optional, requiring reference only to elements relating to the current enrollment capacity of the district and the district office, library, and supporting facility capacities. The bill would also provide that enrollment projections, if used, would instead be formulated with the cooperation of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges.
    (4) Existing law requires the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to adopt regulations providing for the payment of apportionments to community college districts on a specified schedule that includes a first principal apportionment to be certified on or before February 20 of each year, and a 2nd principal apportionment to be certified on or before June 25 of each year. Existing law defers the drawing of those warrants, as specified. Existing law appropriates $592,456,000 from the General Fund to the board of governors, for expenditure during the 2014–15 fiscal year, in satisfaction of specified moneys whose payment to the California Community Colleges has been deferred.
    This bill would, for purposes of calculations required by the California Constitution, instead provide that $138,602,000, $296,354,000, and $157,500,000 of the $592,456,000 appropriated to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges for the 2014–15 fiscal year in satisfaction of deferred payments shall be deemed General Fund revenues and included in the total allocations to school districts and community college districts for the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 fiscal years, respectively, as specified. This bill would also provide for the deferral of $94,465,000 from June 2015 to July 2015, and would appropriate money in July 2015 to pay for that deferred amount, which would be deemed General Fund revenues and included in the total allocations to school districts and community college districts for the 2015–16 fiscal year.
    (5) Existing law provides for the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program under which each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families and individuals. Existing law requires that, to the extent that funding is provided in the annual Budget Act, a community college shall receive funding for educational services provided to CalWORKs recipients based on the number of CalWORKs recipients that are enrolled at the community college and the scope and number of programs that the college plans to offer to assist CalWORKs recipients to obtain employment. Existing law also requires that, prior to receiving funding, a community college shall submit to the chancellor a Request for Application that contains a plan for curriculum development or redesign, including participation by the county welfare department to establish that the programs being developed or redesigned will provide CalWORKs recipients with the training and experience necessary to secure employment. Existing law also provides that, to the extent that funding is provided in the annual Budget Act, funds received by a community college for curriculum development or redesign for CalWORKs recipients may be expended for various purposes, including the development or redesign of vocational curricula for CalWORKs recipients so that courses may be offered as part of a short-term intensive program, including Open Entry and Open Exit programs.
    This bill would state that a community college district shall receive funding for providing specified additional services to current and, under certain condition, certain prior CalWORKs recipients, including job placement, coordination with county welfare offices and other local agencies, child care and workstudy, instruction, postemployment skills training and related skills training, and case management, as specified. The bill would require the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to develop an equitable method for allocating funds under these provisions to all community college districts, and to compile a report on the program annually from specified information required to be provided by the community college districts and colleges. By requiring certain actions by community college districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
    (6) Existing law provides, in calculating each community college district’s revenue level each fiscal year, that the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges shall subtract, from the total revenues owed, certain amounts, including certain amounts received by certain provisions of existing law relating to redevelopment that, for purposes of community college revenue levels, are considered to be from property tax revenues.
    This bill would, notwithstanding the required reduction, provide that specified revenues received after April 15, 2014, April 15, 2015, and April 15, 2016, shall be counted as revenues received in the 2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17 fiscal years, respectively.
    (7) Existing law requires the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to develop criteria and standards, in accordance with specified statewide minimum requirements, for the purposes of making the annual budget request for the California Community Colleges to the Governor and the Legislature, and allocating state general apportionment revenues. Those statewide minimum requirements include, among other things, a requirement that the calculations of each community college district’s revenue level for each fiscal year be based on specified criteria, with revenue adjustments being made for increases or decreases in full-time equivalent students and for other specified purposes.
    This bill would require the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to develop, and the board of governors to adopt, a revised apportionment growth formula for use commencing with the 2015–16 fiscal year. The bill would provide that the revised formula shall support the primary missions of the segment, and shall be based on certain factors, as specified, and would require the chancellor, on or before October 15, 2015, and each year thereafter, to report to the Legislature on certain matters related to the revised apportionment growth formula. The bill would, notwithstanding certain apportionment related provisions for the 2014–15 and 2015–16 fiscal years, require the board of governors to provide the San Francisco Community College District with revenues, as specified, if, on the effective date of this bill, the board of governors finds that the community college district or a campus of the community college district is in imminent jeopardy of losing its accreditation, the board of governors has exercised its authority pursuant to specified provisions, and the institution is in compliance with a regulation requiring it to be accredited by a specified agency. The bill would require the board of governors to additionally provide the San Francisco Community College District with revenues for the 2016–17 fiscal year under the same conditions applicable to the 2014–15 and 2015–16 fiscal years, but only if the Fiscal Crisis Management Assistance Team makes a finding no sooner than April 1, 2016, that the San Francisco Community College District is meeting or exceeding specified fiscal benchmarks.
    This bill would, among other things, require the chancellor, in coordination with community college districts, to approve and publicly post annual segmentwide and community college district goals, and would require the chancellor, in coordination with stakeholders, specified committees of the Legislature, and the Department of Finance, to develop, and the board of governors to adopt, a framework of indicators designed to measure and assess the ongoing condition of a community college’s operational environment in specified areas. The bill would, subject to the availability of funding in the annual Budget Act, require the board of governors and the chancellor to assess the degree to which each community college district is improving, as provided.
    (8) Existing law, the Seymour-Campbell Student Success Act of 2012, provides that the purpose of the act is to increase California community college student access and success by providing effective core matriculation services of orientation, assessment and placement, counseling, and other education planning services, and academic interventions. The act specifies the responsibilities of students and institutions in entering into the matriculation process, and requires the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to develop a formula for allocating funding for the Student Success and Support Program that would be implemented under the act.
    This bill would require, as a condition for receiving Student Success and Support Program funding, that the governing board of each community college district maintain a student equity plan, as specified, and would require the chancellor to make an annual report related to those plans. By adding to the duties of community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
    (9) Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, and the University of California, administered by the Regents of the University of California, as 2 of the segments of public postsecondary education in the state. Existing law authorizes the California State University and the University of California to each issue revenue bonds, secured by a specified pledge of revenues. Existing law authorizes the University of California to pledge its annual General Fund support appropriation, less certain amounts, to secure the payment of its general revenue bonds or commercial paper associated with the general revenue bond program. Existing law authorizes the University of California to fund debt service for capital expenditures, as defined, from its General Fund support appropriation, as specified. Existing law also authorizes the University of California to fund pay-as-you-go capital outlay projects from its General Fund support appropriation, as specified. Existing law, for purposes of these provisions, requires the University of California to obtain approval from the Department of Finance pursuant to specified procedures.
    This bill would authorize the California State University to pledge its annual General Fund support appropriation, less certain amounts, to secure the payment of its debt obligations issued by the Trustees pursuant to the State University Revenue Bond Act of 1947. The bill would authorize the California State University to fund debt service for capital expenditures, as defined, from its General Fund support appropriation, as specified. The bill would authorize the California State University to secure bonds for capital expenditures and certain projects with revenues received in accordance with these provisions, as specified. The bill would provide that “capital expenditures” and “capital outlay projects” shall include the cost to design, construct, or equip energy conservation projects. The bill would also authorize the California State University to fund pay-as-you-go capital outlay projects from its General Fund support appropriation, as specified. The bill would, for purposes of these provisions, provide procedures for the California State University to, and would revise the procedures for the University of California to, obtain approval from the Department of Finance, as specified.
    (10) Existing law requires the California State University and the University of California to report, by March 1 of each year, on specified performance measures, including various calculations of graduation rates and amounts spent per degree, for the preceding academic year.
    This bill would revise those provisions to, among other things, extend the due date for the report to March 15, add a 4-year transfer graduation rate as a performance measure for the California State University, and limit transfer student performance measures to transfer students from the California Community Colleges.
    (11) Notwithstanding existing law that imposes greater limits on temporary employment of faculty, existing law provides that a person serving as full-time clinical nursing faculty or as part-time clinical nursing faculty may be employed by any one district for up to 4 semesters or 6 quarters within any period of 3 consecutive academic years between July 1, 2007, to June 30, 2014, inclusive.
    This bill would extend that authorization to December 31, 2015.
    (12) Existing law authorizes the trustees by rule to require all persons to pay fees, rents, deposits, and charges for services, facilities, or materials provided by the trustees to those persons. Existing law prohibits specified California State University campus-based mandatory fees from being reallocated without an affirmative vote of the majority of the members of either the student body or a specified campus fee advisory committee voting on the fee reallocation, unless the vote that established the fee authorizes an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee.
    This bill would prohibit a campus or the Chancellor of the California State University from approving a student success fee, as defined, before January 1, 2016. This bill would require the chancellor to conduct a review of the trustees’ fee policy related to student success fees, submit recommended changes to the fee policy to the trustees, consider specified information in conducting that review and in preparing his or her recommended changes to the policy, and submit a report regarding those proposed changes to the Department of Finance and the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature, on or before February 1, 2015.
    (13) Existing law establishes various health research grant programs, including the Cancer Research Program, the Breast Cancer Research Program, and the Spinal Cord Injury Research Program.
    This bill would enact the California Blueprint for Research to Advance Innovations in Neuroscience (Cal-BRAIN) Act of 2014, and would request the Regents of the University of California to establish the Cal-BRAIN program to leverage California’s research assets and the federal BRAIN Initiative’s funding opportunities to accelerate the development of brain mapping techniques, including the development of new technologies, in order to achieve certain goals. The bill would additionally request the University of California to convene certain stakeholders to develop a governing structure for the Cal-BRAIN program designed to do specified tasks, and to provide information about the program through an Internet Web site. These provisions would only be implemented to the extent that adequate funding is appropriated to the University of California, as specified.
    (14) Existing law, the California Educational Facilities Authority Act, authorizes the California Educational Facilities Authority to, among other things, hold or invest in student loans, create pools of student loans, and sell bonds bearing interest on a taxable or tax-exempt basis or other interests backed by the pools of student loans. Existing law, for purposes of the act, defines “student loan” as a loan having terms and conditions acceptable to the authority that is made to finance or refinance the costs of attendance at a private college or public college and that is approved by the authority, if the loan is originated pursuant to a program that is approved by the authority. Existing law establishes the Assumption Program of Loans for Education, administered by the Student Aid Commission, under which any person enrolled in a eligible institution of postsecondary education or any person who agrees to participate in a teacher trainee or teacher internship program, is eligible to enter into an agreement for loan assumption, as specified.
    This bill would, for purposes of the California Educational Facilities Authority Act, provide that “student loan” may also mean a loan assumption pursuant to the Assumption Program of Loans for Education.
    (15) Under the California Constitution, whenever the Legislature or a state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government, including a school district and a community college district, the state is required to provide a subvention of funds to reimburse the local government, with specified exceptions. Existing law makes certain funds appropriated in the annual Budget Act for reimbursement of the cost of a new program or increased level of service of an existing program mandated by statute or executive order available as a block grant to school districts, charter schools, county offices of education, and community college districts, to support specified state-mandated local programs. Existing law provides that a school district, charter school, county office of education, or community college district that submits a letter of intent to the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, as appropriate, and receives this block grant funding is not eligible to submit a claim for reimbursement for those specified mandated programs for the fiscal year for which the block grant funding is received.
    This bill would revise the list of programs that are authorized for block grant funding in lieu of program-specific reimbursement.
    (16) Existing law imposes a filing fee of $605 to file a notice of appeal in a civil case. Existing law requires, until January 1, 2015, that $65 of this fee be deposited into the California State Law Library Special Account for the support of the California State Law Library.
    This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2020.
    (17) Existing law allocates responsibility for enforcement of building standards adopted by the State Fire Marshal and published in the California Building Standards Code relating to fire and panic safety and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal, as provided. Existing law provides that the State Fire Marshal shall enforce the building standards and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal on all University of California campuses and properties administered or occupied by the University of California, and, for each university campus or property, authorizes the State Fire Marshal to delegate that responsibility to a person of his or her choice.
    This bill would also require the State Fire Marshal to enforce the building standards and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal on all California State University campuses and properties administered or occupied by the California State University.
    (18) Existing authorizes the Trustees of the California State University to receive bids for the construction of several public works projects at one campus of the California State University as a single project. Existing law requires, when it appears that the estimated contract price will exceed $15,000, that public notice to bidders be given by publication, as specified.
    This bill would delete the one-campus restriction on taking bids for several public works as a single project. The bill would also authorize notice by publication electronically on the California State University’s Internet Web site.
    (19) Item 6870-139-8080 of the Budget Act of 2013, as added by Chapter 20 of the Statues of 2013, appropriated $47,000,000 to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges for local assistance, payable from the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund.
    This bill would reappropriate the balances of those amounts to the board of governors, for the same purposes, and would provide that those funds would be available for encumbrance until June 30, 2018.
    (20) This bill would require amounts to be determined by the Director of Finance to be appropriated, on or before June 30, 2015, from the General Fund to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges in the event that specified revenues distributed to community colleges are less than estimated amounts reflected in the Budget Act of 2014.
    (21) This bill would require amounts to be determined by the Director of Finance to be appropriated, on or before June 30, 2015, from the General Fund to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges in augmentation of a certain schedule of an item of the Budget Acts of 2012 and 2013, and would require these funds to only be available for revenues distributed to a net excess tax community college district, as determined by the Director of Finance.
    (22) This bill would authorize the University of California to use General Fund appropriations made pursuant to specified sections of the Education Code for the Tolman Hall Seismic Replacement Building project at the University of California, Berkeley, campus, as described.
    (23) This bill would make conforming changes, delete obsolete provisions, correct cross-references, and make other nonsubstantive changes.
    (24) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
    This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
    (25) Funds appropriated by this bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
    (26) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.",
        tldr = "This bill would make various changes to education finance, including specifying eligibility criteria for Cal Grant award recipients, increasing the maximum allowable 3-year cohort default rate for Cal Grant-eligible institutions, and increasing the maximum Cal Grant A and B awards for new recipients attending private nonprofit postsecondary institutions. It would also establish the Middle Class Scholarship Program, require community college districts to submit a plan for capital construction, and provide for the deferral of certain payments to community college districts. The bill would also require the California State University to pledge its annual General Fund support appropriation to secure debt obligations and fund capital expenditures, and would extend the authorization for full-time and part-time clinical nursing faculty employment. It would also require the California State University to conduct a review of student success fees and make various changes to the California Educational Facilities Authority Act. The bill would also revise the list of programs authorized for block grant funding in lieu of program-specific reimbursement, extend the operation of certain provisions related to filing fees for civil case appeals, and require the State Fire Marshal to enforce building standards on California State University campuses. The bill would also authorize the Trustees of the California State University to receive bids for public works projects at multiple campuses as a single project, reappropriate funds from the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund, and require the Director of Finance to appropriate funds to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges under certain conditions.

        digest = "(1) Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement Awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B Awards, the Cal Grant C Awards, and the Cal Grant T Awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. Existing law provides that a qualifying institution with a graduation rate of 30% or less for students taking 150% or less of the expected time to complete degree requirements is ineligible for initial and renewal Cal Grant awards, unless the institution has a 3-year cohort default rate that is less than 10% and a graduation rate above 20% for students taking 150% or less of the expected time to complete degree requirements. Existing law sets the maximum Cal Grant A and B awards for new recipients attending private nonprofit postsecondary education institutions at $8,056 for the 2014–15 award year and each award year thereafter.
    This bill would specify eligibility criteria that, commencing with the 2014–15 academic year, would apply to Cal Grant award recipients who were determined to be ineligible for a renewal award because they exceeded the maximum household income or asset level, or failed to meet the minimum need threshold, as specified, but who subsequently meet eligibility requirements for a Cal Grant award. The bill would also increase from 10% to 15.5% the maximum allowable 3-year cohort default rate for an institution with a 20% to 30% graduation rate for students taking no more than 150% of the expected time to complete degree requirements to be eligible for Cal Grant awards. The bill would increase the maximum Cal Grant A and B awards for new recipients attending a private nonprofit postsecondary institution, for the 2014–15 award year only, to $9,084.
    (2) Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission as the primary state agency for the administration of state-authorized student financial aid programs available to students attending all segments of postsecondary education. Existing law establishes the Middle Class Scholarship Program under the administration of the Student Aid Commission. The program provides that, subject to an available and sufficient appropriation, commencing with the 2014–15 academic year, an undergraduate student enrolled at the University of California or the California State University is eligible for a scholarship award that, combined with other publicly funded student financial aid, is up to 40% of the amount charged to that student for mandatory systemwide tuition in that fiscal year if the student meets the following conditions: has an annual household income that does not exceed $150,000; satisfies specified requirements for a Cal Grant award; is a resident of this state or exempt from paying nonresident tuition; files specified financial aid forms; makes timely application or applications for publicly funded student financial aid, as defined, for which he or she is eligible; and maintains at least a 2.0 grade point average.
    This bill would, among other things, specify that the scholarship award under the Middle Class Scholarship Program, combined with other federal, state, and institutionally administered grants and fee waivers, would be for up to 40% of the systemwide tuition and fees. The bill would require a recipient to be enrolled at least part-time and would require the recipient to be pursuing his or her first undergraduate baccalaureate degree, unless he or she is enrolled in a specified professional teacher preparation program. The bill would also provide that the minimum scholarship amount for any full-time student who qualifies for a scholarship award of $1 is $90, and would prohibit discrimination against part-time students in the selection of award recipients.
    (3) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law authorizes the establishment of community college districts under the administration of community college governing boards, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction at community college campuses throughout the state. Existing law requires the governing board of each community college district to prepare and submit to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges a plan for capital construction for community college purposes of the district, as specified. Existing law requires a 5-year plan for capital construction to set out the estimated capital construction needs of the district with reference to specified elements, including enrollment projections for each community college district, formulated by the Department of Finance with the cooperation of each community college district.
    This bill would make reference to certain of these specified elements optional, requiring reference only to elements relating to the current enrollment capacity of the district and the district office, library, and supporting facility capacities. The bill would also provide that enrollment projections, if used, would instead be formulated with the cooperation of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges.
    (4) Existing law requires the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to adopt regulations providing for the payment of apportionments to community college districts on a specified schedule that includes a first principal apportionment to be certified on or before February 20 of each year, and a 2nd principal apportionment to be certified on or before June 25 of each year. Existing law defers the drawing of those warrants, as specified. Existing law appropriates $592,456,000 from the General Fund to the board of governors, for expenditure during the 2014–15 fiscal year, in satisfaction of specified moneys whose payment to the California Community Colleges has been deferred.
    This bill would, for purposes of calculations required by the California Constitution, instead provide that $138,602,000, $296,354,000, and $157,500,000 of the $592,456,000 appropriated to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges for the 2014–15 fiscal year in satisfaction of deferred payments shall be deemed General Fund revenues and included in the total allocations to school districts and community college districts for the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 fiscal years, respectively, as specified. This bill would also provide for the deferral of $94,465,000 from June 2015 to July 2015, and would appropriate money in July 2015 to pay for that deferred amount, which would be deemed General Fund revenues and included in the total allocations to school districts and community college districts for the 2015–16 fiscal year.
    (5) Existing law provides for the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program under which each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families and individuals. Existing law requires that, to the extent that funding is provided in the annual Budget Act, a community college shall receive funding for educational services provided to CalWORKs recipients based on the number of CalWORKs recipients that are enrolled at the community college and the scope and number of programs that the college plans to offer to assist CalWORKs recipients to obtain employment. Existing law also requires that, prior to receiving funding, a community college shall submit to the chancellor a Request for Application that contains a plan for curriculum development or redesign, including participation by the county welfare department to establish that the programs being developed or redesigned will provide CalWORKs recipients with the training and experience necessary to secure employment. Existing law also provides that, to the extent that funding is provided in the annual Budget Act, funds received by a community college for curriculum development or redesign for CalWORKs recipients may be expended for various purposes, including the development or redesign of vocational curricula for CalWORKs recipients so that courses may be offered as part of a short-term intensive program, including Open Entry and Open Exit programs.
    This bill would state that a community college district shall receive funding for providing specified additional services to current and, under certain conditions, certain prior CalWORKs recipients, including job placement, coordination with county welfare offices and other local agencies, child care and workstudy, instruction, postemployment skills training and related skills training, and case management, as specified. The bill would require the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to develop an equitable method for allocating funds under these provisions to all community college districts, and to compile a report on the program annually from specified information required to be provided by the community college districts and colleges. By requiring certain actions by community college districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
    (6) Existing law provides, in calculating each community college district’s revenue level each fiscal year, that the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges shall subtract, from the total revenues owed, certain amounts, including certain amounts received pursuant to certain provisions of existing law relating to redevelopment that, for purposes of community college revenue levels, are considered to be from property tax revenues.
    This bill would, notwithstanding the required reduction, provide that specified revenues received after April 15, 2014, April 15, 2015, and April 15, 2016, shall be counted as revenues received in the 2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17 fiscal years, respectively.
    (7) Existing law requires the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to develop criteria and standards, in accordance with specified statewide minimum requirements, for the purposes of making the annual budget request for the California Community Colleges to the Governor and the Legislature, and allocating state general apportionment revenues. Those statewide minimum requirements include, among other things, a requirement that the calculations of each community college district’s revenue level for each fiscal year be based on specified criteria, with revenue adjustments being made for increases or decreases in full-time equivalent students and for other specified purposes.
    This bill would require the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to develop, and the board of governors to adopt, a revised apportionment growth formula for use commencing with the 2015–16 fiscal year. The bill would provide that the revised formula shall support the primary missions of the segment, and shall be based on certain factors, as specified, and would require the chancellor, on or before October 15, 2015, and each year thereafter, to report to the Legislature on certain matters related to the revised apportionment growth formula. The bill would, notwithstanding certain apportionment-related provisions for the 2014–15 and 2015–16 fiscal years, require the board of governors to provide the San Francisco Community College District with revenues, as specified, if, on the effective date of this bill, the board of governors finds that the community college district or a campus of the community college district is in imminent jeopardy of losing its accreditation, the board of governors has exercised its authority pursuant to specified provisions, and the institution is in compliance with a regulation requiring it to be accredited by a specified agency. The bill would require the board of governors to additionally provide the San Francisco Community College District with revenues for the 2016–17 fiscal year under the same conditions applicable to the 2014–15 and 2015–16 fiscal years, but only if the Fiscal Crisis Management Assistance Team makes a finding no sooner than April 1, 2016, that the San Francisco Community College District is meeting or exceeding specified fiscal benchmarks.
    This bill would, among other things, require the chancellor, in coordination with community college districts, to approve and publicly post annual segmentwide and community college district goals, and would require the chancellor, in coordination with stakeholders, specified committees of the Legislature, and the Department of Finance, to develop, and the board of governors to adopt, a framework of indicators designed to measure and assess the ongoing condition of a community college’s operational environment in specified areas. The bill would, subject to the availability of funding in the annual Budget Act, require the board of governors and the chancellor to assess the degree to which each community college district is improving, as provided.
    (8) Existing law, the Seymour-Campbell Student Success Act of 2012, provides that the purpose of the act is to increase California community college student access and success by providing effective core matriculation services of orientation, assessment and placement, counseling, and other education planning services, and academic interventions. The act specifies the responsibilities of students and institutions in entering into the matriculation process, and requires the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to develop a formula for allocating funding for the Student Success and Support Program that would be implemented under the act.
    This bill would require, as a condition for receiving Student Success and Support Program funding, that the governing board of each community college district maintain a student equity plan, as specified, and would require the chancellor to make an annual report related to those plans. By adding to the duties of community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
    (9) Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, and the University of California, administered by the Regents of the University of California, as 2 of the segments of public postsecondary education in the state. Existing law authorizes the California State University and the University of California to each issue revenue bonds, secured by a specified pledge of revenues. Existing law authorizes the University of California to pledge its annual General Fund support appropriation, less certain amounts, to secure the payment of its general revenue bonds or commercial paper associated with the general revenue bond program. Existing law authorizes the University of California to fund debt service for capital expenditures, as defined, from its General Fund support appropriation, as specified. Existing law also authorizes the University of California to fund pay-as-you-go capital outlay projects from its General Fund support appropriation, as specified. Existing law, for purposes of these provisions, requires the University of California to obtain approval from the Department of Finance pursuant to specified procedures.
    This bill would authorize the California State University to pledge its annual General Fund support appropriation, less certain amounts, to secure the payment of its debt obligations issued by the Trustees pursuant to the State University Revenue Bond Act of 1947. The bill would authorize the California State University to fund debt service for capital expenditures, as defined, from its General Fund support appropriation, as specified. The bill would authorize the California State University to secure bonds for capital expenditures and certain projects with revenues received in accordance with these provisions, as specified. The bill would provide that “capital expenditures” and “capital outlay projects” shall include the cost to design, construct, or equip energy conservation projects. The bill would also authorize the California State University to fund pay-as-you-go capital outlay projects from its General Fund support appropriation, as specified. The bill would, for purposes of these provisions, provide procedures for the California State University to, and would revise the procedures for the University of California to, obtain approval from the Department of Finance, as specified.
    (10) Existing law requires the California State University and the University of California to report, by March 1 of each year, on specified performance measures, including various calculations of graduation rates and amounts spent per degree, for the preceding academic year.
    This bill would revise those provisions to, among other things, extend the due date for the report to March 15, add a 4-year transfer graduation rate as a performance measure for the California State University, and limit transfer student performance measures to transfer students from the California Community Colleges.
    (11) Notwithstanding existing law that imposes greater limits on temporary employment of faculty, existing law provides that a person serving as full-time clinical nursing faculty or as part-time clinical nursing faculty may be employed by any one district for up to 4 semesters or 6 quarters within any period of 3 consecutive academic years between July 1, 2007, to June 30, 2014, inclusive.
    This bill would extend that authorization to December 31, 2015.
    (12) Existing law authorizes the trustees by rule to require all persons to pay fees, rents, deposits, and charges for services, facilities, or materials provided by the trustees to those persons. Existing law prohibits specified California State University campus-based mandatory fees from being reallocated without an affirmative vote of the majority of the members of either the student body or a specified campus fee advisory committee voting on the fee reallocation, unless the vote that established the fee authorizes an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee.
    This bill would prohibit a campus or the Chancellor of the California State University from approving a student success fee, as defined, before January 1, 2016. This bill would require the chancellor to conduct a review of the trustees’ fee policy related to student success fees, submit recommended changes to the fee policy to the trustees, consider specified information in conducting that review and in preparing his or her recommended changes to the policy, and submit a report regarding those proposed changes to the Department of Finance and the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature, on or before February 1, 2015.
    (13) Existing law establishes various health research grant programs, including the Cancer Research Program, the Breast Cancer Research Program, and the Spinal Cord Injury Research Program.
    This bill would enact the California Blueprint for Research to Advance Innovations in Neuroscience (Cal-BRAIN) Act of 2014, and would request the Regents of the University of California to establish the Cal-BRAIN program to leverage California’s research assets and the federal BRAIN Initiative’s funding opportunities to accelerate the development of brain mapping techniques, including the development of new technologies, in order to achieve certain goals. The bill would additionally request the University of California to convene certain stakeholders to develop a governing structure for the Cal-BRAIN program designed to do specified tasks and to provide information about the program through an Internet Web site. These provisions would only be implemented to the extent that adequate funding is appropriated to the University of California, as specified.
    (14) Existing law, the California Educational Facilities Authority Act, authorizes the California Educational Facilities Authority to, among other things, hold or invest in student loans, create pools of student loans, and sell bonds bearing interest on a taxable or tax-exempt basis or other interests backed by the pools of student loans. Existing law, for purposes of the act, defines “student loan” as a loan having terms and conditions acceptable to the authority that is made to finance or refinance the costs of attendance at a private college or public college and that is approved by the authority, if the loan is originated pursuant to a program that is approved by the authority. Existing law establishes the Assumption Program of Loans for Education, administered by the Student Aid Commission, under which any person enrolled in an eligible institution of postsecondary education or any person who agrees to participate in a teacher trainee or teacher internship program, is eligible to enter into an agreement for loan assumption, as specified.
    This bill would, for purposes of the California Educational Facilities Authority Act, provide that “student loan” may also mean a loan assumption pursuant to the Assumption Program of Loans for Education.
    (15) Under the California Constitution, whenever the Legislature or a state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government, including a school district and a community college district, the state is required to provide a subvention of funds to reimburse the local government, with specified exceptions. Existing law makes certain funds appropriated in the annual Budget Act for reimbursement of the cost of a new program or increased level of service of an existing program mandated by statute or executive order available as a block grant to school districts, charter schools, county offices of education, and community college districts, to support specified state-mandated local programs. Existing law provides that a school district, charter school, county office of education, or community college district that submits a letter of intent to the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, as appropriate, and receives this block grant funding is not eligible to submit a claim for reimbursement for those specified mandated programs for the fiscal year for which the block grant funding is received.
    This bill would revise the list of programs that are authorized for block grant funding in lieu of program-specific reimbursement.
    (16) Existing law imposes a filing fee of $605 to file a notice of appeal in a civil case. Existing law requires, until January 1, 2015, that $65 of this fee be deposited into the California State Law Library Special Account for the support of the California State Law Library.
    This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2020.
    (17) Existing law allocates responsibility for enforcement of building standards adopted by the State Fire Marshal and published in the California Building Standards Code relating to fire and panic safety and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal, as provided. Existing law provides that the State Fire Marshal shall enforce the building standards and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal on all University of California campuses and properties administered or occupied by the University of California, and, for each university campus or property, authorizes the State Fire Marshal to delegate that responsibility to a person of his or her choice.
    This bill would also require the State Fire Marshal to enforce the building standards and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal on all California State University campuses and properties administered or occupied by the California State University.
    (18) Existing law authorizes the Trustees of the California State University to receive bids for the construction of several public works projects at one campus of the California State University as a single project. Existing law requires, when it appears that the estimated contract price will exceed $15,000, that public notice to bidders be given by publication, as specified.
    This bill would delete the one-campus restriction on taking bids for several public works as a single project. The bill would also authorize notice by publication electronically on the California State University’s Internet Web site.
    (19) Item 6870-139-8080 of the Budget Act of 2013, as added by Chapter 20 of the Statues of 2013, appropriated $47,000,000 to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges for local assistance, payable from the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund.
    This bill would reappropriate the balances of those amounts to the board of governors, for the same purposes, and would provide that those funds would be available for encumbrance until June 30, 2018.
    (20) This bill would require amounts to be determined by the Director of Finance to be appropriated, on or before June 30, 2015, from the General Fund to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges in the event that specified revenues distributed to community colleges are less than estimated amounts reflected in the Budget Act of 2014.
    (21) This bill would require amounts to be determined by the Director of Finance to be appropriated, on or before June 30, 2015, from the General Fund to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges in augmentation of a certain schedule of an item of the Budget Acts of 2012 and 2013, and would require these funds to only be available for revenues distributed to a net excess tax community college district, as determined by the Director of Finance.
    (22) This bill would authorize the University of California to use General Fund appropriations made pursuant to specified sections of the Education Code for the Tolman Hall Seismic Replacement Building project at the University of California, Berkeley, campus, as described.
    (23) This bill would make conforming changes, delete obsolete provisions, correct cross-references, and make other nonsubstantive changes.
    (24) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
    This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
    (25) Funds appropriated by this bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
    (26) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.",

        digest = "(1) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the 3 segments of public postsecondary education in this state.
    Existing law authorizes the board of governors, to the extent that funds are available, to establish certain internship training programs and to actively support apprenticeship training programs in collaboration with the Division of Apprenticeship Standards of the Department of Industrial Relations. Existing law requires the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to allocate funds for approved apprenticeship programs in good standing and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to allocate funds solely for the purposes of reimbursing community colleges.
    This bill would authorize, if reimbursement is not claimed pursuant to the above provision relating to apprenticeship program reimbursement, the attendance of apprentices enrolled in any class offered for community college credit by a community college in collaboration with an apprenticeship program sponsor to be reimbursed, as prescribed, as part of a specified budget formula developed by the board of governors. The bill would require, for each community college receiving reimbursement for apprenticeship hours pursuant to this provision, the affected community college district to report to the chancellor specified information for each apportionment period. To the extent that this provision would impose additional duties on community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
    The bill would require the chancellor to report specified information relating to apprenticeship program reimbursements to the California Apprenticeship Council and to consult with the council in annually reviewing reimbursement funding. The bill would require the chancellor and the Division of Apprenticeship Standards of the Department of Industrial Relations, in consultation with the council and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, to develop standard reporting protocols applicable to participating community colleges and local educational agencies contracting with apprenticeship program sponsors that include metrics to measure program efficiency and success.
    (2) Existing law provides, until January 1, 2019, that the board of trustees, common council, or other legislative body of a city or the board of trustees of a library district in which a withdrawal from the county free library system becomes effective on or after January 1, 2012, shall comply with specified requirements before entering into a contract to operate the city’s or library district’s library or libraries with a private contractor that will employ library staff to achieve cost savings, subject to specified exceptions.
    This bill would delete the repeal date for these provisions, thereby extending operation of these provisions indefinitely.
    (3) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to operate schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. Existing law establishes in the State Department of Education a division known as the California State Library.
    This bill would create the California Student Author Project as a grant program for the benefit of public school age children from extremely low-income communities. The bill would require the California State Library to provide grant awards to nonprofit organizations, public libraries, and local educational entities, as specified. The bill would require a grant recipient, during the 2019–20 and 2020–21 school years, to establish a literacy program for public school age children who are eligible for free and reduced cost lunch. The bill would require a grant recipient to establish a student author program to provide the participants an opportunity to write, edit, and promote a short story or other forms of literature, and would require a grant recipient to provide regular, sequential student author workshops that parallel or complement school calendars with specified components. The bill would require grant recipients to collect and provide information to the California State Library and require the California State Library, not later than January 1, 2022, to report to the Legislature on the outcomes of the California Student Author Program.
    (4) Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Board of Trustees of the California State University, and the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, as 2 of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law requires the California State University, and requests the University of California, to annually report to the Legislature on their respective institutional financial aid programs and to provide preliminary reports on or before January 10 of each year and the final reports on or before March 31 of each year. Existing law requires the preliminary reports to include, among other things, the average and 90th percentile parental income level, expected family contribution, and the financial need of undergraduate need-based student institutional gift aid recipients for the prior 2 academic years.
    This bill would delete those preliminary reports and would instead require that the reports due on or before March 31 of each year include the data and information required in those preliminary reports, except for the average and 90th percentile parental income level, expected family contribution, and financial need data, which the bill would delete. The bill would require the reports to include additional information, as specified.
    (5) Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and independent institutions of higher education as the 4 segments of postsecondary education in this state. Existing provisions of the Donahoe Higher Education Act set forth the missions and functions of these 4 postsecondary educational segments. The Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act encourages community colleges to facilitate the acceptance of credits earned at other community colleges toward the associate degree for transfer. The act also requires the California State University to guarantee admission with junior status to a community college student who meets the requirements for the associate degree for transfer, and provides that admission to the California State University under these provisions does not guarantee admission for specific majors or campuses. Existing law recognizes that the University of California has been working with the California Community Colleges to seek improvements to the transfer process and states the intent of the Legislature that the University of California consider various viable pathways to transfer, including the development of an associate degree for transfer granted by community college districts, as part of this endeavor.
    This bill would add provisions to the Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act that apply to a private nonprofit postsecondary education institution that chooses to accept students with an associate degree for transfer. The bill would require the Chancellor’s Office of the California Community Colleges and the private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions that choose to commit to accept a student with an associate degree for transfer, in consultation with specified parties, to develop a student-centered communication and marketing strategy in order to increase the visibility of the associate degree for transfer pathway for all students in California. To the extent that this provision would create new duties for community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
    (6) Existing law establishes the maximum tuition award amount for each Cal Grant A and B award for new recipient students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions at $9,084 for the 2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–18 award years and $8,056 for the 2018–19 award year and each award year thereafter.
    This bill would retain the maximum tuition award amount for each Cal Grant A and B award for new recipient students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions at $9,084 for the 2018–19 award year. Beginning with the 2019–20 award year, the maximum tuition award would either be $9,084 or $8,056, depending upon whether the number of new unduplicated transfer students accepted by private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions who have been given associate degree for transfer commitments, as defined, in the prior award year meet or exceed specified targets.
    (7) Existing law states the intent of the Legislature that private nonprofit and for-profit postsecondary educational institutions with students receiving Cal Grant awards make good faith efforts to (1) increase the number of low-income resident students enrolled, (2) make the process for transferring from the California Community Colleges easier for resident students, and (3) expand high-quality online education for resident students, as specified.
    This bill would instead state the intent of the Legislature that a private nonprofit postsecondary educational institution make a good faith effort to make the process for transferring from the California Community Colleges easier for resident students and a decision determining the maximum award amounts made pursuant to the program for students attending a private nonprofit postsecondary educational institution will be made with consideration of the effort of the institution to make that process easier.
    (8) Existing law establishes the California State University, the California Community Colleges, and the University of California as the 3 segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law exempts students who have been granted special immigrant visas pursuant to a specified federal statute, or are refugees admitted to the United States under a specified federal statute, and who, upon entering the United States, settled in California, from paying nonresident tuition at the California Community Colleges. Existing law authorizes a community college district to report a student, who is exempt from nonresident tuition under this provision and who is enrolled as a student of that district, as a full-time equivalent student for apportionment purposes.
    This bill would exempt students granted special immigrant visas pursuant to an additional federal statute from paying nonresident tuition at the California Community Colleges. To the extent that this bill would place additional requirements on community college districts to exempt those students from nonresident tuition, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
    (9) Existing law establishes the maximum tuition award amounts for each Cal Grant A and B award for new recipients attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions beginning with the 2013–14 award year at $4,000.
    Beginning with the 2018–19 award year, the bill would establish a maximum tuition award of $9,084 for attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, unless otherwise specified in the Budget Act of 2018.
    (10) Existing law provides that any California resident is entitled to a Cal Grant B Entitlement award, and requires the commission to allocate that award, if certain criteria are met, including that the student submit a complete financial aid application, submitted or postmarked no later than March 2 of the academic year of high school graduation or its equivalent for the award year immediately following the academic year of high school graduation or its equivalent, or no later than March 2 of the academic year following high school graduation or its equivalent for the 2nd award year following the year of high school graduation or its equivalent.
    This bill would provide alternative deadlines for submitting a complete financial aid application for a student who is a current or former foster youth, who is attending a qualifying institution that offers baccalaureate degrees or is attending a California community college, and has not yet reached 26 years of age as of July 1 of the initial award year.
    Existing law authorizes the renewal of Cal Grant B awards for a total of the equivalent of 4 years of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, provided that minimum financial need, as defined, continues to exist, subject to certain exceptions.
    This bill would authorize the renewal of Cal Grant B awards, for a current or former foster youth, for a total of the equivalent of 8 years of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, provided that minimum financial need continues to exist.

    (42) This bill would appropriate $5,000,000 from the General Fund to the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges for allocation to a community college district or districts participating in a Strong Workforce Program regional consortium to provide one-time grants in support of refugee career pathways. The bill would provide that the chancellor’s office would allocate grants to community college districts that partner with eligible organizations, as defined, and that provide career readiness training to eligible participants, as defined, pursuant to specified federal statutes, to include persons with special immigrant visas and persons who are refugees admitted to the United States.
    The funds allocated to community college districts pursuant to the bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
    (43) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
    This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
    (44) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.",

        digest = "(1) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the 3 segments of public postsecondary education in this state.
    Existing law authorizes the board of governors, to the extent that funds are available, to establish certain internship training programs and to actively support apprenticeship training programs in collaboration with the Division of Apprenticeship Standards of the Department of Industrial Relations. Existing law requires the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to allocate funds for approved apprenticeship programs in good standing and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to allocate funds solely for the purposes of reimbursing community colleges.
    This bill would authorize, if reimbursement is not claimed pursuant to the above provision relating to apprenticeship program reimbursement, the attendance of apprentices enrolled in any class offered for community college credit by a community college in collaboration with an apprenticeship program sponsor to be reimbursed, as prescribed, as part of a specified budget formula developed by the board of governors. The bill would require, for each community college receiving reimbursement for apprenticeship hours pursuant to this provision, the affected community college district to report to the chancellor specified information for each apportionment period. To the extent that this provision would impose additional duties on community college districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
    The bill would require the chancellor to report specified information relating to apprenticeship program reimbursements to the California Apprenticeship Council and to consult with the council in annually reviewing reimbursement funding. The bill would require the chancellor and the Division of Apprenticeship Standards of the Department of Industrial Relations, in consultation with the council and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, to develop standard reporting protocols applicable to participating community colleges and local educational agencies contracting with apprenticeship program sponsors that include metrics to measure program efficiency and success.
    (2) Existing law provides, until January 1, 2019, that the board of trustees, common council, or other legislative body of a city or the board of trustees of a library district in which a withdrawal from the county free library system becomes effective on or after January 1, 2012, shall comply with specified requirements before entering into a contract to operate the city’s or library district’s library or libraries with a private contractor that will employ library staff to achieve cost savings, subject to specified exceptions.
    This bill would delete the repeal date for these provisions, thereby extending operation of these provisions indefinitely.
    (3) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to operate schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. Existing law establishes in the State Department of Education a division known as the California State Library.
    This bill would create the California Student Author Project as a grant program for the benefit of public school age children from extremely low-income communities. The bill would require the California State Library to provide grant awards to nonprofit organizations, public libraries, and local educational entities, as specified. The bill would require a grant recipient, during the 2019–20 and 2020–21 school years, to establish a literacy program for public school age children who are eligible for free and reduced cost lunch. The bill would require a grant recipient to establish a student author program to provide the participants an opportunity to write, edit, and promote a short story or other forms of literature, and would require a grant recipient to provide regular, sequential student author workshops that parallel or complement school calendars with specified components. The bill would require grant recipients to collect and provide information to the California State Library and require the California State Library, not later than January 1, 2022, to report to the Legislature on the outcomes of the California Student Author Program.
    (4) Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Board of Trustees of the California State University, and the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, as 2 of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law requires the California State University, and requests the University of California, to annually report to the Legislature on their respective institutional financial aid programs and to provide preliminary reports on or before January 10 of each year and the final reports on or before March 31 of each year. Existing law requires the preliminary reports to include, among other things, the average and 90th percentile parental income level, expected family contribution, and the financial need of undergraduate need-based student institutional gift aid recipients for the prior 2 academic years.
    This bill would delete those preliminary reports and would instead require that the reports due on or before March 31 of each year include the data and information required in those preliminary reports, except for the average and 90th percentile parental income level, expected family contribution, and financial need data, which the bill would delete. The bill would require the reports to include additional information, as specified.
    (5) Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and independent institutions of higher education as the 4 segments of postsecondary education in this state. Existing provisions of the Donahoe Higher Education Act set forth the missions and functions of these 4 postsecondary educational segments. The Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act encourages community colleges to facilitate the acceptance of credits earned at other community colleges toward the associate degree for transfer. The act also requires the California State University to guarantee admission with junior status to a community college student who meets the requirements for the associate degree for transfer, and provides that admission to the California State University under these provisions does not guarantee admission for specific majors or campuses. Existing law recognizes that the University of California has been working with the California Community Colleges to seek improvements to the transfer process and states the intent of the Legislature that the University of California consider various viable pathways to transfer, including the development of an associate degree for transfer granted by community college districts, as part of this endeavor.
    This bill would add provisions to the Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act that apply to a private nonprofit postsecondary education institution that chooses to accept students with an associate degree for transfer. The bill would require the Chancellor’s Office of the California Community Colleges and the private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions that choose to commit to accept a student with an associate degree for transfer, in consultation with specified parties, to develop a student-centered communication and marketing strategy in order to increase the visibility of the associate degree for transfer pathway for all students in California. To the extent that this provision would create new duties for community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
    (6) Existing law establishes the maximum tuition award amount for each Cal Grant A and B award for new recipient students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions at $9,084 for the 2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–18 award years and $8,056 for the 2018–19 award year and each award year thereafter.
    This bill would retain the maximum tuition award amount for each Cal Grant A and B award for new recipient students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions at $9,084 for the 2018–19 award year. Beginning with the 2019–20 award year, the maximum tuition award would either be $9,084 or $8,056, depending upon whether the number of new unduplicated transfer students accepted by private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions who have been given associate degree for transfer commitments, as defined, in the prior award year meet or exceed specified targets.
    (7) Existing law states the intent of the Legislature that private nonprofit and for-profit postsecondary educational institutions with students receiving Cal Grant awards make good faith efforts to (1) increase the number of low-income resident students enrolled, (2) make the process for transferring from the California Community Colleges easier for resident students, and (3) expand high-quality online education for resident students, as specified.
    This bill would instead state the intent of the Legislature that a private nonprofit postsecondary educational institution make a good faith effort to make the process for transferring from the California Community Colleges easier for resident students and a decision determining the maximum award amounts made pursuant to the program for students attending a private nonprofit postsecondary educational institution will be made with consideration of the effort of the institution to make that process easier.
    (8) Existing law establishes the California State University, the California Community Colleges, and the University of California as the 3 segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law exempts students who have been granted special immigrant visas pursuant to a specified federal statute, or are refugees admitted to the United States under a specified federal statute, and who, upon entering the United States, settled in California, from paying nonresident tuition at the California Community Colleges. Existing law authorizes a community college district to report a student, who is exempt from nonresident tuition under this provision and who is enrolled as a student of that district, as a full-time equivalent student for apportionment purposes.
    This bill would exempt students granted special immigrant visas pursuant to an additional federal statute from paying nonresident tuition at the California Community Colleges. To the extent that this bill would place additional requirements on community college districts to exempt those students from nonresident tuition, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
    (9) Existing law establishes the maximum tuition award amounts for each Cal Grant A and B award for new recipients attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions beginning with the 2013–14 award year at $4,000.
    Beginning with the 2018–19 award year, the bill would establish a maximum tuition award of $9,084 for attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, unless otherwise specified in the Budget Act of 2018.
    (10) Existing law provides that any California resident is entitled to a Cal Grant B Entitlement award, and requires the commission to allocate that award, if certain criteria are met, including that the student submit a complete financial aid application, submitted or postmarked no later than March 2 of the academic year of high school graduation or its equivalent for the award year immediately following the academic year of high school graduation or its equivalent, or no later than March 2 of the academic year following high school graduation or its equivalent for the 2nd award year following the year of high school graduation or its equivalent.
    This bill would provide alternative deadlines for submitting a complete financial aid application for a student who is a current or former foster youth, who is attending a qualifying institution that offers baccalaureate degrees or is attending a California community college, and has not yet reached 26 years of age as of July 1 of the initial award year.
    Existing law authorizes the renewal of Cal Grant B awards for a total of the equivalent of 4 years of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, provided that minimum financial need, as defined, continues to exist, subject to certain exceptions.
    This bill would authorize the renewal of Cal Grant B awards, for a current or former foster youth, for a total of the equivalent of 8 years of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, provided that minimum financial need continues to exist.
    (11) Under existing law, the Middle Class Scholarship Program provides that an undergraduate student enrolled at the University of California or the California State University, or enrolled in upper division coursework in a community college baccalaureate program, and meeting certain requirements, is eligible for a scholarship award that, combined with other federal, state, and institutionally administered grants and fee waivers, totals up to 40% of the systemwide tuition and fees.
    Existing law transfers $74,000,000 from the General Fund to the Middle Class Scholarship Fund for the 2016–17 fiscal year, $96,000,000 from the General Fund to the Middle Class Scholarship Fund for the 2017–18 fiscal year, $117,000,000 from the General Fund to the Middle Class Scholarship Fund for the 2018–19 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, and appropriates those sums to the Student Aid Commission for purposes of the scholarship program.
    The bill would decrease the existing appropriation for the 2016–17 fiscal year from $74,000,000 to $71,244,000, would increase the existing appropriation for the 2017–18 fiscal year from $96,000,000 to $99,797,000, would decrease the existing appropriation for the 2018–19 fiscal year from $117,000,000 to $101,380,000, and would maintain the existing appropriation for the 2019–20 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter at $117,000,000.
    (12) Existing law authorizes the governing board of a community college district to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) partnership with the governing board of a school district with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college for career technical education or preparation for transfer, improving high school graduation rates, or helping high school pupils achieve college and career readiness. Existing law requires the partnership agreement to outline the terms of the partnership, as specified, and to establish protocols for information sharing, joint facilities use, and parental consent for high school pupils to enroll in community college courses. These provisions are repealed on January 1, 2022.
    This bill would authorize the governing body of a charter school to enter into a CCAP partnership agreement with the governing board of a community college district pursuant to these provisions.
    Existing law authorizes a community college district to limit enrollment in a community college course solely to eligible high school pupils if the course is offered at a high school campus, as provided.
    This bill would authorize a community college district to limit enrollment in a community college course solely to eligible high school pupils if the course is offered at a high school campus, either in person or using an online platform, as provided.
    Existing law requires each CCAP partnership affected community college district and school district to annually report specified information to the office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges.
    This bill would require this report to include the total number of full-time equivalent students served online generated by CCAP partnership community college district participants.
    Existing law provides that attendance of a high school pupil at a community college as a special part-time or full-time student pursuant to a CCAP is authorized attendance for which the community college shall be credited or reimbursed, as provided. Existing law requires a charter school to offer, at minimum, a specified number of minutes to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive.
    This bill would provide that, for purposes of calculating classroom-based average daily attendance for classroom-based instruction apportionments, at least 80% of the instructional time offered by a charter school pursuant to an authorized CCAP partnership agreement shall be at the schoolsite, and the charter school shall require the attendance of a pupil for a minimum of 50% of the minimum instructional time required to be offered, as specified, if the pupil is also a special part-time student enrolled in a community college pursuant to the partnership agreement and the pupil will receive academic credit upon satisfactory completion of enrolled courses.
    (13) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law requires the board of governors to appoint a chief executive officer, to be known as the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges. Existing law establishes community college districts, administered by governing boards, throughout the state, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction to students at the community college campuses maintained by the districts.
    Upon appropriation by the Legislature for its purposes, this bill would establish a grant program, under the administration of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, to create new and innovative apprenticeship opportunities in priority and emerging industry sectors or areas in which apprenticeship training is not fully established or does not exist.
    (14) Existing law requires, except where provided, the governing board of a community college district to grant without charge the use of any college facility or grounds under its control, when an alternative location is not available, to nonprofit organizations and clubs and associations organized for general character building or welfare purposes. Existing law requires, for entertainment or a meeting where an admission fee is charged or a contribution is solicited and the net receipts of the admission fees or contributions are not expended for the welfare of the students of the district or for charitable purposes, a charge of equal to fair rental value for the use of the college facilities, property, and grounds, as determined by the governing board of the district.
    This bill would instead require that, for entertainment or a meeting where an admission fee is charged or a contribution is solicited and the net receipts of the admission fees or contributions are not expended for the welfare of the students of the district or for charitable purposes, a charge of not less than fair rental value is to be levied for the use of the college facilities, property, and grounds as determined by the governing board of the district.
    (15) Existing law requires that the accounting system used to record the financial affairs of a community college district be in accord with the definitions, instructions, and procedures published in the California Community Colleges Budget and Accounting Manual as approved and furnished by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges. Existing law requires the governing board of each community college district to provide for an annual audit of all funds, books, and accounts of the district in accordance with regulations of the board of governors. Existing law requires the board of governors, in cooperation with, and upon approval by, the Department of Finance, to prescribe the statements and other information to be included in the audit reports filed with the state and to develop audit procedures relative to specified formal actions taken by community college districts with respect to encouraging the retirement of academic employees and the granting of service credits.
    This bill would strike the requirement that the Department of Finance cooperate and provide approval when the board of governors prescribes the statements and other information to be included in audit reports and develops audit procedures.
    (16) Existing law requires that adult schools and evening high schools consist of classes for adults. Existing law authorizes minors to be admitted into those classes pursuant to policies adopted by the governing board of the school district if those minors meet certain eligibility requirements.
    Existing law creates the Adult Education Block Grant Program under the administration of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Under this program, the chancellor and Superintendent, with the advice of the executive director of the State Board of Education, are required to divide the state into adult education regions and approve one adult education consortium in each adult education region. Existing law also requires, as a condition of receipt of an apportionment of funds from this program for a fiscal year, that members of a consortium approve an adult education plan, as specified.
    This bill instead would require, commencing with the 2019–20 fiscal year, as a condition of receipt of an apportionment of funds from the program for a fiscal year, that members of a consortium approve a consortium-approved 3-year adult education plan that addresses a 3-year fiscal planning cycle. The bill would require the plan to be updated at least once each year, as specified. The bill also would also provide, for the 2018–19 fiscal year, as a condition of receipt of an apportionment of funds from the program, the members of a consortium to have a consortium-approved adult education plan that meets specified requirements.
    (17) Existing law establishes the Adult Education Block Grant Program under the administration of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Under this program, the chancellor and Superintendent, with the advice of the executive director of the State Board of Education, are required to divide the state into adult education regions and approve one adult education consortium in each adult education region. Existing law requires funds apportioned for the program to be used only for the support of specified programs, including, among others, programs in elementary and secondary basic skills and programs for adults that are primarily related to the entry or reentry into the workforce.
    This bill would additionally include the indirect costs of the program’s consortium members, as specified, among the purposes that funds apportioned for the program may be used.
    (18) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary education in this state. Under this system, local educational agencies throughout the state provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. Existing law also establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law authorizes the California Community Colleges to grant associate degrees.
    This bill would establish a grant program as a public-private partnership between school districts, community college districts, and private businesses for purposes of preparing California students for high-skill jobs of the future in the STEM field. The bill would specify the core benefits of the program for participating students in grades 9 to 14, including an opportunity to earn an associate of science degree in a high-tech field or an associate degree for transfer in a STEM field.
    This bill would appropriate $10,000,000 from the General Fund to the chancellor’s office for this program.
    (19) Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Board of Trustees of the California State University, as one of the 3 segments of public postsecondary education in California. Existing law requires the trustees to appoint a chief executive officer, known as the Chancellor of the California State University.
    This bill would require the Office of the Chancellor of the California State University to require each California State University campus to prepare an annual report on student admissions and impaction policies, as specified. The bill would require the chancellor’s office to compile each of these reports and submit a systemwide report to the Legislature and the Department of Finance on or before May 1, 2020, and each May 1 annually thereafter. The bill would make its provisions inoperative on July 1, 2023.
    (20) Existing law establishes the University of California as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. The California Constitution provides that the University of California constitutes a public trust administered by the regents of the University of California, a corporation in the form of a board, with full powers of organization and government, subject to legislative control only for specified purposes.
    This bill would request the University of California, by April 1 of each year, to report to the Legislature on the systemwide and presidential initiatives of the university, including a description of each initiative and a justification for the initiative that explains how it furthers the mission of the university, and the total expenditures and revenue sources for each initiative.
    (21) Existing law requires a test sponsor or test agency, as defined, to provide data and information, with respect to the administration of standardized tests for purposes of postsecondary education, to the California Postsecondary Education Commission.
    This bill would instead require the test sponsor or test agency to provide that data and information to the appropriate state agency or make that data or information available on the test sponsor or test agency’s Internet Web site.
    (22) Existing law requires, as a condition of receiving federal funds provided under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1998, or a successor of that act, and to the extent permitted under federal law, that school districts, regional occupational centers or programs, and community college districts comply with specified requirements relating to the development of course sequences.
    This bill would authorize the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to distribute funds provided by the federal Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990, and any acts amending or succeeding those acts, to community college districts using the principal apportionment payment schedule.
    (23) The Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act authorizes an employee or annuitant, as those terms are defined, of the state to enroll in a health benefit plan approved or maintained by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System. The act generally requires the state and each employee or annuitant to contribute a portion of the cost of providing the benefit coverage afforded under the approved health benefit plan in which the employee or annuitant is enrolled. The act prohibits specified employees from receiving an employer contribution for these benefits for annuitants unless the person is credited with 10 or more years, or 15 or more years, of state service, depending on date of first hire.
    The State Employees’ Dental Care Act authorizes the state, through the Department of Human Resources, the Trustees of the California State University, or the Regents of the University of California, to contract with carriers for dental care plans for employees, annuitants, and eligible family members, as provided. The act generally authorizes a person who was enrolled in a dental care plan at the time he or she became an annuitant under state or federal provisions to continue his or her enrollment. The act prohibits specified employees from receiving an employer contribution for these benefits for annuitants unless the person is credited with 10 or more years, or 15 or more years, of state service, depending on date of first hire.
    This bill, with respect to both the Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act and the State Employees’ Dental Care Act, would additionally prohibit an employee of the California State University who is first employed by the California State University and becomes a member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System on or after July 1, 2018, and who is represented by California State University Bargaining Unit 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, or 10, from receiving any portion of the employer contribution for these benefits for annuitants unless the employee has 10 years of credited state service at the time of retirement.

    (24) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. The board appoints a chief executive officer known as the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges. Under existing law, community college districts are authorized, among other things, to maintain and operate campuses, employ faculty and other employees, and provide instruction to students.
    Existing law establishes the Community College Completion Grant Program, which, commencing with the 2017–18 academic year, requires participating community colleges to award grants to their students who meet specified requirements. Existing law requires the chancellor to report to the Legislature, on or before April 1, 2019, regarding grant award recipients for the 2017–18 award year, as specified.
    This bill would repeal the existing Community College Completion Grant Program and instead, commencing with the 2018–19 academic year, would establish a new grant program, which would require participating community colleges to award grants to their students who meet specified requirements, contingent on funding being made available.

Existing law requires a community college district to update the plan every 3 academic years.
    This bill would establish the Student Equity and Achievement Program and would state the intent of the Legislature that funds for the program support the California Community Colleges in implementing activities and practices pursuant to the California Community College Guided Pathways Grant Program and activities and practices that advance the systemwide goal to eliminate achievement gaps for students from traditionally underrepresented groups. The bill would require a district, as a condition of the receipt of funds under the Student Equity and Achievement Program, to comply with specified requirements, including maintain a student equity plan to ensure equal educational opportunities and promote student success for all students, regardless of race, gender, age, disability, or economic circumstances.

    Existing law authorizes the governing board of any community college to establish and maintain classes for adults for the purpose of providing instruction in civic, vocational, literacy, health, homemaking, technical, and general education.
    This bill would, commencing with the 2019–20 fiscal year, require the chancellor’s office and the State Department of Education to coordinate so that an adult enrolled in the specified classes is assigned a student identifier consistent with the identifiers assigned to pupils in K–12 education programs, if the student is not already identified, as specified, and for the chancellor’s office to include these students in the Adult Education Program data system.
    Existing law establishes the Adult Education Block Grant Program under the administration of the chancellor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction.

Existing law requires the board of governors to develop criteria and standards, in accordance with specified statewide minimum requirements, for the purposes of making the annual budget request for the California Community Colleges to the Governor and the Legislature, and allocating state general apportionment revenues. Those statewide minimum requirements include, among other things, a requirement that the calculations of each community college district’s revenue level for each fiscal year be based on specified criteria, with revenue adjustments being made for increases or decreases in full-time equivalent students and for other specified purposes.
    This bill would revise and recast those provisions providing for allocating state general apportionment revenues, except for allocating revenues provided pursuant to Proposition 55 and computing allocations for noncredit instruction and career development and college preparation full-time equivalent students (FTES), to community college districts by, among other things, (1) setting new rates for the base allocations, (2) providing supplemental allocations based on the number of students served that receive Board of Governor fee waivers, are exempt from nonresident tuition pursuant to specified provisions, or receive financial aid under the Federal Pell Grant program, (3) providing student success allocations, as prescribed, and (4) establishing hold harmless provisions to ensure a minimum level of funding to community college districts, as provided, including provisions to allocate different apportionments to the San Francisco Community College District and the Compton Community College District through the 2023–24 fiscal year.

The bill would require a business in California that provides a person, as defined, with a program or device that uses an automated decision system (ADS) to take affirmative steps to ensure that there are processes in place to continually test for biases during the development and usage of the ADS, conduct an ADS impact assessment on its program or device to determine whether the ADS has a disproportionate adverse impact on a protected class, as specified, examine if the ADS in question serves reasonable objectives and furthers a legitimate interest, and compare the ADS to alternatives or reasonable modifications that may be taken to limit adverse consequences on protected classes. The bill would require a business, by March 1, 2022, and annually thereafter, to submit a report to the Department of Business Oversight summarizing the results of its ADS impact assessment for each program or device that uses an ADS. The bill would also require a business, if it makes any significant modification to an ADS, to reconduct an ADS impact assessment under these circumstances.
        The bill would require the department, by January 1, 2022, to develop a procedure for businesses to use in making the required reports and to make general information on the reporting process available on its internet website. The bill would require the department, if a business fails to comply with these procedures, to send a written notice to the business regarding its failure to comply, and would require the business to submit the report within 60 days of the date of that notice. The bill would make violations of these provisions subject to a civil penalty.
        The bill would also require the department, by March 1, 2022, to establish an Automated Decision Systems Advisory Task Force, composed of various representatives from the public and private sectors, for the purpose of reviewing and providing advice on the use of automated decision systems in businesses, government, and various other settings.",

        WHEREAS, The first National Woman’s Day was observed in the United States in 1909 in honor of the 1908 garment workers’ strike in New York, where women protested against working conditions; and
        WHEREAS, International Women’s Day was marked for the first time in 1911 by Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland, where more than one million women and men attended rallies demanding the rights for women to vote and to hold public office, women’s rights to work, to vocational training, and to an end to discrimination on the job; and
        WHEREAS, In 1913–14, International Women’s Day also became a mechanism for protesting World War I. As part of the peace movement, Russian women observed their first International Women’s Day on the last Sunday in February, and elsewhere in Europe, on or around March 8 of the following year, women held rallies either to protest the war or to express solidarity with other activists; and
        WHEREAS, In 1917, against the backdrop of the war, women in Russia again chose to protest and strike for “Bread and Peace” on the last Sunday in February, which fell on March 8 on the Gregorian calendar. Four days later, the Czar abdicated and the provisional government granted women the right to vote; and
        WHEREAS, In 1975, during International Women’s Year, the United Nations began celebrating International Women’s Day on March 8; and
        WHEREAS, In 1979, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and the international treaty, described as an international bill of rights for women, was instituted on September 3, 1981, and has been ratified by 189 states; and
        WHEREAS, International Women’s Day has assumed a new global dimension for women in developed and developing countries alike. The growing international women’s movement has helped make the commemoration a rallying point to build support for women’s rights and participation in the political and economic arenas; and
        WHEREAS, International Women’s Day is a time to reflect on progress made, to call for change, and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities; and
        WHEREAS, The United Nations has designated the theme for the 2021 International Women’s Day as “Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world.” The theme celebrates the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic; and
        WHEREAS, In addition to persistent, preexisting social and systemic barriers to women’s participation and leadership, with the COVID-19 pandemic new barriers have emerged. Across the world, women face increased domestic violence, unpaid care duties, unemployment, and poverty. Despite women making up a majority of front-line workers, there is disproportionate and inadequate representation of women in national and global COVID-19 policy spaces; and
        WHEREAS, To uphold women’s rights and fully leverage the potential of women’s leadership in pandemic preparedness and response, the perspectives of women and girls in all of their diversity must be integrated in the formulation and implementation of policies and programs in all spheres and at all stages of pandemic response and recovery; and
        WHEREAS, Innovation and technology provide unprecedented opportunities, yet trends indicate a growing gender digital divide, and women are underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and design. This prevents women from developing and influencing gender-responsive innovations to achieve transformative gains for society. From mobile banking to artificial intelligence and the internet, it is vital that women’s ideas and experiences equally influence the design and implementation of the innovations that will shape our future societies; and
        WHEREAS, International Women’s Day stands as a reminder of the long history of women’s social activism and organizing; fighting for equal wages, better working conditions, and the right to vote and that while women make up more than one-half of our population, they are disproportionately represented in our state; too few in leadership positions and too many who live in poverty; now, therefore, be it
        Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, That the Senate designates March 8, 2021, as International Women’s Day; and be it further
        Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies of this resolution to the author for appropriate distribution.",

        digest = "Existing federal law, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), requires each state to establish an American Health Benefit Exchange to facilitate the purchase of qualified health benefit plans by qualified individuals and qualified small employers. PPACA defines a “qualified health plan” as a plan that, among other requirements, provides an essential health benefits package. Existing state law creates the California Health Benefit Exchange, also known as Covered California, to facilitate the enrollment of qualified individuals and qualified small employers in qualified health plans as required under PPACA.
        Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law provides for the MediCal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The MediCal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.
        This bill, the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act, would create the California Guaranteed Health Care for All program, or CalCare, to provide comprehensive universal single-payer health care coverage and a health care cost control system for the benefit of all residents of the state. The bill, among other things, would provide that CalCare cover a wide range of medical benefits and other services and would incorporate the health care benefits and standards of other existing federal and state provisions, including the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program, MediCal, ancillary health care or social services covered by regional centers for persons with developmental disabilities, Knox-Keene, and the federal Medicare program. The bill would require the board to seek all necessary waivers, approvals, and agreements to allow various existing federal health care payments to be paid to CalCare, which would then assume responsibility for all benefits and services previously paid for with those funds.
        This bill would create the CalCare Board to govern CalCare, made up of 9 voting members with demonstrated and acknowledged expertise in health care, and appointed as provided, plus the Secretary of California Health and Human Services or their designee as a nonvoting, ex officio member. The bill would provide the board with all the powers and duties necessary to establish CalCare, including determining when individuals may start enrolling into CalCare, employing necessary staff, negotiating pricing for covered pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, establishing a prescription drug formulary, and negotiating and entering into necessary contracts. The bill would require the board, on or before July 1, 2024, to conduct and deliver a fiscal analysis to determine whether or not CalCare may be implemented and whether revenue is more likely than not to pay for program costs, as specified. The bill would require the board to convene a CalCare Public Advisory Committee with specified members to advise the board on all matters of policy for CalCare. The bill would establish an 11-member Advisory Commission on Long-Term Services and Supports to advise the board on matters of policy related to long-term services and supports.
        This bill would provide for the participation of health care providers in CalCare, including the requirements of a participation agreement between a health care provider and the board, provide for payment for health care items and services, and specify program participation standards. The bill would prohibit a participating provider from discriminating against a person by, among other things, reducing or denying a person’s benefits under CalCare because of a specified characteristic, status, or condition of the person.
        This bill would prohibit a participating provider from billing or entering into a private contract with an individual eligible for CalCare benefits regarding a covered benefit, but would authorize contracting for a health care item or service that is not a covered benefit if specified criteria are met. The bill would authorize health care providers to collectively negotiate fee-for-service rates of payment for health care items and services using a 3rd-party representative, as provided. The bill would require the board to annually determine an institutional provider’s global budget, to be used to cover operating expenses related to covered health care items and services for that fiscal year, and would authorize payments under the global budget.
        This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would develop a revenue plan, taking into consideration anticipated federal revenue available for CalCare. The bill would create the CalCare Trust Fund in the State Treasury, as a continuously appropriated fund, consisting of any federal and state moneys received for the purposes of the act. Because the bill would create a continuously appropriated fund, it would make an appropriation.
        This bill would prohibit specified provisions of this act from becoming operative until the Secretary of California Health and Human Services gives written notice to the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly that the CalCare Trust Fund has the revenues to fund the costs of implementing the act. act, the people of California have approved the necessary revenue mechanisms, and the Legislature has approved implementation of the CalCare by statute. The California Health and Human Services Agency would be required to publish a copy of the notice on its internet website.
        Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

        shortTitle = "Solid waste: reporting, packaging, and plastic food service ware",
        date = "2021-01-07",
        title = "(1) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, generally regulates the disposal, management, and recycling of solid waste. The act requires disposal facility operators to submit information to the department on the disposal tonnages that are disposed of at the disposal facility, and requires solid waste handlers and transfer station operators to provide information to disposal facility operators for purposes of that requirement. The act requires recycling and composting operations and facilities to submit periodic information to the department on the types and quantities of materials that are disposed of, sold, or transferred to other recycling or composting facilities or specified entities.
        This bill would provide that these reporting requirements do not apply to materials that are used by facilities defined as end users pursuant to the regulations adopted by the department or that are otherwise exempt pursuant to those regulations. The bill would also clarify that recycling is not limited to the processing of materials that would otherwise become solid waste, but also includes processes applied to nonhazardous materials that have value principally as a feedstock for that processing, regardless of whether the materials have been discarded or constitute solid waste. The bill would further clarify that, regardless of whether a recycling operation or facility is required to register and report pursuant to specified regulations adopted by the department, that recycling operation or facility is not a solid waste handler unless the operation or facility is, in fact, handling solid waste.
        (2) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 regulates the disposal, management, and recycling of, among other solid waste, plastic packaging containers and single-use foodware accessories.
        The Sustainable Packaging for the State of California Act of 2018 prohibits a food service facility located in a state-owned facility, operating on or acting as a concessionaire on state property or under contract to provide food service to a state agency, from dispensing prepared food using a type of food service packaging unless the type of food service packaging is on a list that the department publishes and maintains on its internet website that contains types of approved food service packaging that are reusable, recyclable, or compostable.
        Existing law makes a legislative declaration that it is the policy goal of the state that, annually, not less than 75% of solid waste generated be source reduced, recycled, or composted.
        This bill would establish the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act, which would cover certain single-use packaging and plastic single-use food service ware, as provided. As part of its comprehensive statutory scheme, the bill would require the producers, as defined, of these covered materials to source reduce plastic covered material, to ensure that covered material offered for sale, distributed, or imported in or into the state on or after January 1, 2032, is recyclable or compostable, and to ensure that plastic covered material offered for sale, distributed, or imported in or into the state meets specified recycling rates. In particular, the bill would require not less than 65% of plastic covered material to be recycled on and after January 1, 2032, and would authorize the department to increase or decrease the specified recycling rates in certain circumstances. The bill would require certain material types and forms to be considered recyclable in the state, and would authorize those material types and forms to be labeled as recyclable, under certain circumstances.
        The bill would prohibit a producer from selling, offering for sale, importing, or distributing covered materials in the state unless the producer is approved to participate in the producer responsibility plan of a producer responsibility organization (PRO), as prescribed, for the source reduction, collection, processing, and recycling of covered material. Alternatively, the bill would require a producer to comply with the act individually without participating in a PRO’s plan. The bill would impose various requirements on PROs and producers in relation to the act, including registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and auditing requirements, and preparing a budget and annual report. The bill would require a PRO or producer to provide certain certifications under penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require a PRO to establish a charge for its participant producers sufficient to ensure the requirements of the act are met by the PRO, and would therefore impose a tax. The bill would specify the purposes for which the revenue from the charge may be spent, including the costs of the PRO, the costs of a producer responsibility advisory board that the bill would create, and other costs specified in the PRO’s budget.
        The bill would require a PRO, commencing in the 2027 calendar year, and until January 1, 2037, to remit a $500,000,000 surcharge each year, as provided, to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) to be deposited into the California Plastic Pollution Mitigation Fund, which the bill would create, and would outline requirements applicable to the collection and administration of the surcharge. The bill would require the PRO to establish and impose on its participant producers an environmental mitigation surcharge in an amount sufficient to raise that sum and to remit those moneys, and would authorize a PRO to collect up to $150,000,000 from plastic resin manufacturers who sell plastic covered material to producers who are participants of the PRO, as prescribed. The bill would therefore impose a tax. The bill would require moneys in the California Plastic Pollution Mitigation Fund to be expended, upon appropriation by the Legislature, by specified state agencies on purposes relating to mitigating the environmental impacts of plastic. The bill would prohibit those appropriations from replacing or reducing funding for those purposes from any other source, including certain appropriations in the Budget Act of 2019.
        The bill would require the department to adopt regulations to implement the act, as prescribed, and would require the department to publish certain information and lists on its internet website. The bill would require that local jurisdictions and recycling service providers include in their collection and recycling programs covered material contained on the lists published by the department, except as specified. By imposing additional requirements on local jurisdictions, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the department to prepare, or to select an independent third-party contractor to complete, one or more initial statewide needs assessments designed to determine the necessary steps and investment needed for covered material to achieve the requirements of the act. The bill would require the PRO to reimburse the department for the cost of developing the needs assessments, thereby imposing a tax.
        The bill would require a PRO to pay a charge named the “California circular economy administrative fee” to the department and would require the department to set the charge at an amount adequate to cover the department’s and any other state agency’s costs of implementing and enforcing the comprehensive statutory scheme. The bill would require the administrative fees to be deposited into the California Circular Economy Fund, which the bill would create. The bill would make moneys in the fund available upon appropriation by the Legislature to the department for the department’s activities pursuant to the act and to reimburse any outstanding loans made from other funds used to finance the initial costs of the department’s activities. The bill would require the department and agencies receiving funding under the act to report specified information to the Legislature concerning the act’s implementation. The bill would require, if the department determines that a PRO or producer has not achieved specified targets established pursuant to the act, the department to adopt regulations that contain certain provisions of the act, as prescribed.
        The bill would provide for its enforcement, including authorizing the department to impose an administrative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $50,000 per day per violation, except as specified, on any entity that is not in compliance with the act’s requirements. The bill would require the department to deposit collected penalties into the Circular Economy Penalty Account, which the bill would create. The bill would make moneys in the account available upon appropriation by the Legislature for purposes that further the act.
        (3) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
        This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
        (4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
        This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
        With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
        (5) This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of 2/3 of the membership of each house of the Legislature.",

Existing law requires the Labor Commissioner to establish and maintain a field enforcement unit in order to ensure that minimum labor standards are adequately enforced. Existing law also establishes the Department of Fair Employment and Housing to investigate and prosecute unlawful employment practices.

The bill would make a covered provider that violates these provisions liable for a civil penalty in the amount of $5,000 per violation to be collected in a civil action filed by the Attorney General, a city attorney, or a county counsel. The bill would, for a violation by a third-party licensee of the requirement to cease using a licensed GenAI system after the license of the system has been revoked, authorize the Attorney General, a county counsel, or a city attorney to bring a civil action for injunctive relief and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.",

        This bill would provide that the bill’s provisions would not apply to specified contracts or subcontracts, including, among others, extensions of contracts or subcontracts, that result from a request for proposal or bid that occurred before January 1, 2025, and contracts by a county human services agency for translation or interpretation services.
        (2) The bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities.
        (3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
        This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.",

The bill would also prohibit a state agency or specified local agency from using, or contracting with a call center that uses, artificial intelligence or automated decision systems that would eliminate or automate core job functions of a worker. The bill would require an agency that utilizes AI or ADS that impact core job functions of workers to notify the workers, their collective bargaining representatives, and the public within a specified timeframe about prescribed information, including a general description of the AI or ADS system.",

        The California Fair Employment and Housing Act establishes the Civil Rights Department within the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency and requires the department to, among other things, bring civil actions to enforce the act. 
        This bill would, among other things, require, as prescribed, a deployer, as defined, and a developer of an automated decision tool, system, as defined, to perform an impact assessment on any automated decision tool system before the system is first deployed and annually thereafter that includes, among other things, a statement of the purpose of the automated decision system and its intended benefits, uses, and deployment contexts. The bill would require a deployer or a developer to provide any impact assessment that it performed to the Civil Rights Department and would exempt an impact assessment provided to the department from the California Public Records Act, as prescribed. 
        This bill would require a deployer to, prior to an automated decision tool system making a consequential decision, as defined, or being a substantial factor, as defined, in making a consequential decision, notify any natural person that is subject to the consequential decision that an automated decision tool system is being used and to provide that person with specified information. The bill would require a deployer that has deployed an automated decision tool system to make, or be a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision concerning a natural person, to provide to the natural person, among other things, an opportunity to correct any incorrect personal data. The bill would, if a consequential decision is made solely based on the output of an automated decision system, require a deployer to, if technically feasible, accommodate a natural person’s request to not be subject to the automated decision tool system and to instead be subject to an alternative selection process or accommodation, as prescribed. 
        This bill would prohibit a deployer from using an automated decision tool system if an impact assessment identifies a reasonable risk of algorithmic discrimination, which the bill would define to mean the condition in which an automated decision system contributes to unlawful discrimination, including differential treatment or impacts disfavoring people based on their actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, sex, religion, age, national origin, limited English proficiency, disability, veteran status, genetic information, reproductive health, or any other classification protected by state or federal law, until that risk has been mitigated. The bill would also prohibit a developer from making available to potential deployers an automated decision tool system until the risk of algorithmic discrimination has been mitigated. 
        This bill would authorize the Civil Rights Department to bring a civil action against a deployer or developer for a violation of the bill and would authorize a court to award, only in an action for a violation involving algorithmic discrimination, a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation. The bill would require the Civil Rights Department to, before commencing an action for injunctive relief, provide 45 days’ written notice to a deployer or developer of the alleged violations of the bill and would provide a deployer or developer a specified opportunity to cure those violations, if the deployer or developer provides the person who gave the notice an express written statement, under penalty of perjury, that the violation has been cured and that no further violations shall occur. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. 
        Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

The CCPA grants to a consumer various rights with respect to personal information, as defined, that is collected by a business, as defined, including the right to request that a business delete personal information about the consumer that the business has collected from the consumer. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, approved by the voters as Proposition 24 at the November 3, 2020, statewide general election, amended, added to, and reenacted the CCPA.

Existing law exempts from these requirements a business that generated less than $100,000,000 in gross revenue during the preceding calendar year.

The bill would establish fees for specified permits, including an initial fee for a permit to practice body contouring that does not exceed $495, and would require those fees to cover the council’s reasonable regulatory costs of administering the program. The bill would require practitioners to comply with specified requirements, including, submitting to inspection and investigation by the council, adhering to the ethical standards prescribed by the council, and not exceeding the legal scope of their permit, among other things.

Existing law imposes various requirements on the Attorney General related to consumer protection, including, among others, the supervision of charitable trusts and the enforcement of antitrust laws. Existing law, commonly known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts that are unlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts and prescribes provisions for its enforcement through civil actions.
        This bill, the California Preventing Algorithmic Collusion Act of 2024 (the act), would require a person, as defined, upon request of the Attorney General, to provide to the Attorney General a written report, as specified, on each pricing algorithm, as defined, identified in the request. The act would require that all information submitted in a report under these provisions be treated as confidential and be considered privileged and confidential trade secrets exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act. The act would authorize the Attorney General to share the report with the National Institute of Standards and Technology for technical assistance in understanding the report, as specified.
        This act would prohibit a person from using or distributing any pricing algorithm that uses, incorporates, or was trained with nonpublic competitor data, as defined. If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person has violated these provisions, the act would authorize the Attorney General to bring a civil action against the person in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state, as specified. The act would provide that certain presumptions are established as applicable, including that the defendant entered into a contract in restraint of trade, as specified, if the Attorney General establishes any of specified requirements, including that the defendant distributed the pricing algorithm to 2 or more persons with the intent that the pricing algorithm be used to set or recommend a price, as defined, or commercial term, as defined, of a product or service in the same market or a related market and 2 or more persons used the pricing algorithm to set or recommend a price or commercial term of a product or service.
        This act would require a person that has $5,000,000 or more in annual revenue that uses a pricing algorithm to recommend or set a price or commercial term to make certain disclosures, as specified, including to a customer, before the customer purchases the relevant product or service, that the price or a commercial term is set or recommended by a pricing algorithm. The act would provide that failure to comply with these disclosure provisions constitutes an unfair trade practice, as specified. If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person has violated these disclosure provisions, the act authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action against the person in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state, as specified.
        Existing law establishes the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz), which serves the Governor as the lead entity for economic strategy and the marketing of California on issues relating to business development, private sector investment, and economic growth. Existing law establishes the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation in the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency, headed by the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation. Under existing law, the department has charge of the execution of specified laws relating to various financial institutions and financial services. Existing law requires the commissioner to publish on the department’s internet website an annual report detailing actions taken during the prior year, including, among others, recommendations intended to result in improved oversight, greater transparency, or increased availability of beneficial financial products and services in the marketplace.
        This act would require, on or before January 1, 2027, the office of the Attorney General to publish on its internet website, and notify the Legislature of the publication of, the results of a study conducted in collaboration with GO-Biz and the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation on the use of pricing algorithms using, incorporating, or trained with either or both public and nonpublic data, as specified, including, among other information, the prevalence of pricing algorithms.
        Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

        This bill would make these provisions inoperative on October 1, 2029, and would repeal them as of January 1, 2030.
        (2) Existing law requires the Geologic Energy Management Division in the Department of Conservation, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, to initiate a study to be conducted by independent experts of fugitive emissions from idle, idle-deserted, and abandoned wells in the state, as provided. Existing law requires oil and gas operators with wells selected for purposes of sampling under these provisions to (1) make reasonable efforts to permit access to the wells to the division and the independent experts contracted to undertake the study if adequate notice is provided to the operator to ensure appropriate safety precautions are taken at the well site, and (2) submit to the division a certification stating that no action was taken to reduce emissions from the sampling site within 72 hours of the sampling taking place so as to reduce the value of measurements taken. A violation of these requirements is a crime. Existing law requires the department, on or before January 1, 2022, to post all results of testing conducted pursuant to the study on the department’s internet website in a machine-readable format. Existing law requires the independent experts contracted to undertake the study, on or before July 1, 2022, to complete a peer-reviewed written document that includes specified elements. Existing law requires the division, on or before January 1, 2023, to make the results of the study, as per the required written document, available on its internet website. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2024.
        This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2029. The bill would change the deadline for the department to post all results of the testing on its internet website from January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2026. The bill would change the deadline for independent experts contracted to undertake the study to complete the written document from July 1, 2022, to July 1, 2026. The bill would change the deadline for the division to make the results of the study available on its internet website from January 1, 2023, to January 1, 2028.
        By extending provisions that the violation of which is a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
        (3) The Z’berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 prohibits a person from conducting timber operations, as defined, unless a timber harvesting plan prepared by a registered professional forester has been submitted to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The act authorizes the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to exempt from some or all of those provisions of the act a person engaging in specified forest management activities, as prescribed, including the one-time conversion of less than 3 acres to a nontimber use, as specified.
        This bill would authorize the board to adopt regulations for a waiver of the one-time limitation, as specified, including a process for an appeal of a denial of a waiver.
        (4) The Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act covers certain single-use packaging and plastic single-use food service ware, as provided. As part of its comprehensive statutory scheme, the act requires producers of those covered materials to reduce and recycle the covered plastic material and to ensure that covered materials that are offered for sale, distributed, or imported in or into the state on or after January 1, 2032, are recyclable or compostable, as provided. The act prohibits a producer from selling, offering for sale, importing, or distributing covered materials in the state unless the producer is approved to participate in the producer responsibility plan of a producer responsibility organization (PRO), as prescribed, for the source reduction, collection, processing, and recycling of covered material, except as provided. The act requires the producer responsibility plan to include certain information, including, but not limited to, arrangements with processors or recyclers to ensure that covered materials that are not collected through a curbside collection program are collected and recycled at a viable responsible end market.
        This bill would instead require a producer responsibility plan to include arrangements with processors or recyclers to ensure that covered materials that are not collected through a curbside collection program or other local collection program are collected and recycled at a viable responsible end market. The bill would require the producer responsibility plan to include a mechanism and schedule for transferring specified fee proceeds to local jurisdictions. The bill would make technical amendments and other revisions to certain components of the act.
        The act defines “covered material” to include, among others, wraps or wrappers and bags sold to food service establishments.
        This bill would instead include as “covered material” wraps or wrappers and bags used in the packaging of food offered for sale or provided to customers by food service establishments.
        The act requires a PRO, commencing in the 2027 calendar year, and until January 1, 2037, to remit a $500,000,000 surcharge each year, as provided, to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) to be deposited into the California Plastic Pollution Mitigation Fund. The act requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to transmit to the CDTFA by March 1 of each year specified information regarding who is liable for the surcharge and in what amounts. The act requires the surcharge be paid 30 days from the date of CDTFA’s assessment. The act requires a producer that is not in a PRO to pay the surcharge on July 1 of each year.
        This bill would recast the surcharge as the “environmental mitigation surcharge.” The bill would delete the July 1 date for the requirement for a producer not in a PRO to pay the environmental mitigation surcharge. The bill would instead require the CDTFA to mail to each person liable for the environmental mitigation surcharge a notice of determination within 90 days of receiving from the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery the information regarding who is liable for the environmental mitigation surcharge and the amounts to be assessed.
        (5) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 establishes the architectural paint recovery program, under which a manufacturer of architectural paint is required, individually or through a stewardship organization, to submit an architectural paint stewardship plan to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to develop and implement a recovery program to reduce the generation of postconsumer architectural paint, promote the reuse of postconsumer architectural paint, and manage the end of life of postconsumer architectural paint. Existing law excludes from the program aerosol spray paint. Existing law requires a manufacturer of architectural paint or a stewardship organization to submit to the department on or before November 1 of each year a report describing its architectural paint recovery efforts.
        This bill would, among other things, eliminate the exemption from the program of aerosol spray paint and would provide that architectural paint includes aerosol coating products, as defined. The bill would specify that aerosol coating products shall not be regulated under the program until the implementation date of a plan or plan amendment concerning aerosol coating products approved by the department or January 1, 2027, whichever occurs sooner, and would authorize the department to extend that implementation date. The bill would require, on or before July 1, 2026, a manufacturer or stewardship organization to submit an architectural paint stewardship plan or amendment to an approved architectural paint stewardship plan to the department. The bill would change the due date for the annual report to on or before May 15 of each year, would require certain information included in the annual report to be reported based on calendar year, and, commencing with the 2028 report, would require the annual report to include certain information on aerosol coating products. The bill would authorize the department, in coordination with the Department of Toxic Substances Control, to adopt regulations to clarify and implement the architectural paint recovery program.
        (6) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 42041 of the Public Resources Code proposed by SB 303 to be operative only if this bill and SB 303 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.
        (7) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
        This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.",

PPACA defines a “qualified health plan” as a plan that, among other requirements, provides an essential health benefits package. Existing state law creates the California Health Benefit Exchange, also known as Covered California, to facilitate the enrollment of qualified individuals and qualified small employers in qualified health plans as required under PPACA.
        Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, 1975 (Knox-Keene), provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law provides for the MediCal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The MediCal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.
        This bill, the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act, would create the California Guaranteed Health Care for All program, or CalCare, to provide comprehensive universal single-payer health care coverage and a health care cost control system for the benefit of all residents of the state. Under the bill, CalCare would be a health care service plan subject to Knox-Keene. The bill, among other things, would provide that CalCare cover a wide range of medical benefits and other services and would incorporate the health care benefits and standards of other existing federal and state provisions, including the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program, MediCal, ancillary health care or social services covered by regional centers for persons with developmental disabilities, Knox-Keene, and the federal Medicare Program. The bill would make specified persons eligible to enroll as CalCare members during the implementation period, and would provide for automatic enrollment. The bill would require the board to seek all necessary waivers, approvals, and agreements to allow various existing federal health care payments to be paid to CalCare, which would then assume responsibility for all benefits and services previously paid for with those funds.
        This bill would create the CalCare Board to govern CalCare, made up of 9 voting members with demonstrated and acknowledged expertise in health care, and appointed as provided, plus the Secretary of California Health and Human Services or their designee as a nonvoting, ex officio member. The bill would provide the board with all the powers and duties necessary to establish CalCare, including determining when individuals may start enrolling into CalCare, employing necessary staff, negotiating pricing for covered pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, establishing a prescription drug formulary, and negotiating and entering into necessary contracts. The bill would require the board, on or before July 1 of an unspecified year, to conduct and deliver a fiscal analysis to determine whether or not CalCare may be implemented and if revenue is more likely than not to pay for program costs, as specified. The bill would establish an Advisory Commission on Long-Term Services and Supports to advise the board on matters of policy related to long-term services and supports. The bill would require the board to convene a CalCare Public Advisory Committee to advise the board on all matters of policy for CalCare, an Advisory Committee on Public Employees’ Retirement System Health Benefits to provide recommendations related to public employee retiree health benefits, and a CalCare Health Workforce Working Group to provide the board with input on issues related to health care workforce education, recruitment, and retention. The bill would establish an Office of Health Equity within CalCare and under the direction of the Director of the Department of Health Care Access and Information to ensure health equity under the program and other health programs of the California Health and Human Services Agency and to support the board through specified actions.
        This bill would provide for the participation of health care providers in CalCare, including the requirements of a participation agreement between a health care provider and the board, provide for payment for health care items and services, and specify program participation standards. The bill would prohibit a participating provider from discriminating against a person by, among other things, reducing or denying a person’s benefits under CalCare because of a specified characteristic, status, or condition of the person.
        This bill would prohibit a participating provider from billing or entering into a private contract with an individual eligible for CalCare benefits regarding a covered benefit, but would authorize contracting for a health care item or service that is not a covered benefit if specified criteria are met. The bill would authorize health care providers to collectively negotiate fee-for-service rates of payment for health care items and services using a 3rd-party third-party representative, as provided. The bill would require the board to annually determine an institutional provider’s global budget, to be used to cover operating expenses related to covered health care items and services for that fiscal year, and would authorize payments under the global budget.
        This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would develop a revenue plan, taking into consideration anticipated federal revenue available for CalCare. The bill would create the CalCare Trust Fund in the State Treasury, as a continuously appropriated fund, consisting of any federal and state moneys received for the purposes of the act. The bill would specify uses for moneys in the CalCare budget, including special projects for which not-for-profit or governmental entities may apply. Because the bill would create a continuously appropriated fund, it would make an appropriation.
        This bill would prohibit specified provisions of this act from becoming operative until the Secretary of California Health and Human Services gives written notice to the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly that the CalCare Trust Fund has the revenues to fund the costs of implementing the act. The California Health and Human Services Agency would be required to publish a copy of the notice on its internet website.
        Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

When a photograph or likeness of an employee of the person using the photograph or likeness appearing in an advertisement or other publication is incidental and not essential to the purpose of the publication, existing law establishes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence that failure to obtain the consent of an employee was not a knowing use of an employee’s photograph or likeness.
        This bill would clarify that, for purposes of this cause of action, a synthetic voice or likeness that a reasonable person would believe to be a genuine voice or likeness, is deemed to be the voice or likeness of the person depicted. The bill would also remove the provisions establishing the rebuttable presumption when an employee’s likeness or photograph appears in an advertisement or other publication.
        (3) Existing law governs the admissibility of evidence in court proceedings. Existing law prescribes procedures for the authentication of photographs and audio and video recordings.
        This bill would require the Judicial Council, by no later than January 1, 2027, to review the impact of artificial intelligence on the introduction of evidence in court proceedings and develop any necessary rules of court to assist courts in assessing claims that evidence that is being introduced has been generated by or manipulated by artificial intelligence.
        (4) Existing law establishes the Department of Consumer Affairs within the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency to protect and promote the interests of consumers. Existing law places certain requirements on various specified businesses, including household movers, tanning facilities, video arcades, and tax preparers.
        This bill would require, by December 1, 2026, any person or entity that sells or provides access to any artificial intelligence technology that is designed to create synthetic content, as defined, to provide a consumer warning that misuse of the technology may result in civil or criminal liability for the user. The bill would require the Department of Consumer Affairs to specify the form and content of the consumer warning and post it on a publicly accessible page of its internet website by July 1, 2026. The bill would also impose a civil penalty for violations of the requirement.",

        Existing law defines “automated decision system” as a computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to assist or replace human discretionary decisionmaking and materially impacts natural persons.

The bill would impose various requirements on an AI auditor that conducts a covered audit, including, among other things, providing the auditee with an audit report after the covered audit.
        This bill would prohibit the AI auditor from accepting employment with an auditee within 12 months of completing a covered audit of the auditee, disclosing confidential information except under certain circumstances, and preventing an employee from engaging in, or retaliating against an employee who has engaged in, specified whistleblower activity.
        This bill would create the AI Auditors’ Enrollment Fund within the State Treasury, to be administered by the agency, and would require that all moneys collected or received by the agency pursuant to the above-described provisions be deposited into the fund to be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to administer the above-described provisions.",

        digest = "The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) grants to a consumer various rights with respect to personal information that is collected by a business, including the right to request that a business delete personal information about the consumer that the business has collected from the consumer. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, an initiative measure approved by the voters as Proposition 24 at the November 3, 2020, statewide general election, amended, added to, and reenacted the CCPA. Existing law, the Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act, establishes privacy standards for the collection, use, and disclosure of information gathered in connection with insurance transactions by insurance institutions, agents, and insurance-support organizations.
    This bill would enact the Insurance Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2025 to establish new standards for the collection, processing, retaining, or sharing of consumers’ personal information by insurance licensees and their third-party service providers. The bill would authorize processing of a consumer’s personal information for specified purposes, including in connection with an insurance transaction. The bill would require a licensee to provide a clear and conspicuous privacy notice that includes specified information to a consumer at specified times, and would prohibit the processing of a consumer’s personal information unless it is consistent with and complies with that notice and is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes related to an insurance transaction or other purpose the consumer requested or authorized. The bill would also require a licensee to provide a privacy rights notice, as specified, to each consumer with whom the licensee has an ongoing business relationship. The bill would authorize a licensee to retain personal information, as specified, and would require a licensee to develop a written records retention policy and schedule. The bill would require a licensee to provide specified information to a consumer if it makes an adverse underwriting decision, and would provide a process by which a consumer may correct, amend, or delete any personal or publicly available information about the consumer in the possession of the licensee or its third-party service providers. The bill would require a contract between a licensee and a third-party service provider to clearly govern the processing of personal information performed on behalf of the licensee. The bill would prohibit retaliation against a consumer because the consumer exercised or attempted to exercise their rights under the act. The bill would prohibit public disclosure of specified systems, processes, policies, procedures, and plans that are disclosed to the Insurance Commissioner.
    To determine if a licensee or third-party service provider has been or is engaged in any conduct in violation of the act, this bill would authorize the commissioner to examine and investigate the licensee or third-party service provider, then hold a hearing regarding those violations. If a hearing results in a finding of a knowing violation, the bill would require the commissioner to issue a cease and desist order and would authorize a penalty of at least $5,000, not to exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate for multiple violations. The bill would authorize additional fines and suspension or revocation of the licensee’s license if a cease and desist order is violated. Under the bill, a person who knowingly and willfully obtains information about a consumer from a licensee or third-party service provider under false pretenses would be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $50,000, imprisonment for not more than one year in a county jail, or both, thus creating a crime and imposing a state-mandated local program.
    Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
    This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
    The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
    This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.",
