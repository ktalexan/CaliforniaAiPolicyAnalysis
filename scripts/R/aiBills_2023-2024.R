Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or disability insurer to use prior authorization and other utilization review or utilization management functions, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. Existing law requires a health care service plan or disability insurer, including those plans or insurers that delegate utilization review or utilization management functions to medical groups, independent practice associations, or to other contracting providers, to comply with specified requirements and limitations on their utilization review or utilization management functions. Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care or the Insurance Commissioner to assess an administrative penalty to a health care service plan or disability insurer, as applicable, for failure to comply with those requirements.
        This bill would require a health care service plan or disability insurer, including a specialized health care service plan or specialized health insurer, that uses an artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool for the purpose of utilization review or utilization management functions, or that contracts with or otherwise works through an entity that uses that type of tool, to ensure compliance with specified requirements, including that the artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool bases its determination on specified information and is fairly and equitably applied, as specified.

        The California Fair Employment and Housing Act protects and safeguards the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination, abridgment, or harassment on account of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, reproductive health decisionmaking, or veteran or military status. The act establishes the Civil Rights Department within the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency and requires the department to, among other things, bring civil actions to enforce the act.
        This bill would, among other things, require a deployer, as defined, and a developer of an automated decision tool, as defined, to, on or before January 1, 2025, and annually thereafter, perform an impact assessment for any automated decision tool the deployer uses that includes, among other things, a statement of the purpose of the automated decision tool and its intended benefits, uses, and deployment contexts. The bill would require a deployer or developer to provide the impact assessment to the Civil Rights Department within 60 days of its completion and would punish a violation of that provision with an administrative fine of not more than $10,000 to be recovered in an administrative enforcement action brought by the Civil Rights Department. The bill would, on and after January 1, 2026, would authorize a person certain public attorneys, including the Attorney General, to bring a civil action against a deployer or developer for a violation of the bill. The bill would require a person public attorney to, before commencing an action for injunctive relief, provide 45 days’ written notice to a deployer or developer of the alleged violations of the bill and would provide a deployer or developer a specified opportunity to cure those violations. violations, if, among other things, the deployer or developer provides the person who gave the notice an express written statement, under penalty of perjury, that the violation has been cured and that no further violations shall occur. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
        This bill would require a deployer to, at or before the time an automated decision tool is used to make a consequential decision, as defined, notify any natural person that is the subject of the consequential decision that an automated decision tool is being used to make, or be a controlling factor in making, the consequential decision and to provide that person with, among other things, a statement of the purpose of the automated decision tool. The bill would, if a consequential decision is made solely based on the output of an automated decision tool, require a deployer to, if technically feasible, accommodate a natural person’s request to not be subject to the automated decision tool and to be subject to an alternative selection process or accommodation, as prescribed.
        This bill would prohibit a deployer from using an automated decision tool in a manner that contributes to that results in algorithmic discrimination, which the bill would define to mean the condition in which an automated decision tool contributes to unjustified differential treatment or impacts disfavoring people based on their actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, sex, religion, age, national origin, limited English proficiency, disability, veteran status, genetic information, reproductive health, or any other classification protected by state law. The bill would, on and after January 1, 2026, authorize a person to bring a civil action against a deployer or developer for a violation of that provision.
        This bill would define “deployer” and “developer” to include a local government agency and would thereby impose a state-mandated local program.

        This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
        With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.",

Existing law provides an exception for contracts between a state agency and a health care service plan or a specialized health care service plan regulated by the Department of Managed Health Care and for contracts between a state agency and a disability insurer or specialized health insurer regulated by the Department of Insurance. Existing law also authorizes the state to terminate a contract relating to services provided by a call center if the contractor or subcontractor performs services with workers not employed in California.

The bill would also prohibit a state agency or specified local agency from using, or contracting with a call center that uses, artificial intelligence (AI) or automated decision systems (ADS) that would eliminate or automate core job functions of a worker, as specified. The bill would require an agency that utilizes AI or ADS that impact core job functions of workers to notify the workers, their collective bargaining representatives, and the public within a specified timeframe about prescribed information, including a general description of the AI or ADS system. The bill would require a contractor to certify in its bid that any services provided by the contractor or its subcontractors are to be performed with and by workers employed in California. The bill would also extend these contracting requirements to local government agencies. By imposing new requirements on local government agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
        This bill would, until July 1, 2030, delete the above-described exception for contracts between a state agency and a health care service plan or a specialized health care service plan regulated by the Department of Managed Health Care and for contracts between a state agency and a disability insurer or specialized health insurer regulated by the Department of Insurance.

By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. 
        Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest. 
        This bill would make legislative findings to that effect. 
        The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. 
        This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.",

The CCPA requires a business that controls the collection of a consumer’s personal information to inform consumers of the categories of personal information collected, the purposes for which the categories of personal information are collected or used, and the length of time the business intends to retain each category of personal information, as specified.
        Existing law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, generally prohibits a government entity from compelling the production of or access to electronic communication information or electronic device information, as defined, without a search warrant, wiretap order, order for electronic reader records, subpoena, or order for a pen register or trap and trace device, except for emergency situations, as specified. The CCPA grants to a consumer various rights with respect to personal information, as defined, that is collected by a business, as defined, including the right to request that a business delete personal information about the consumer that the business has collected from the consumer. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, approved by the voters as Proposition 24 at the November 3, 2020, statewide general election, amended, added to, and reenacted the CCPA.
        Existing law requires a social media company, as defined, to submit reports, as specified, starting no later than January 1, 2024, to the Attorney General, including, but not limited to, the current version of the terms of service for each social media platform owned or operated by the company, specified categories of content and what policies the social media company has for that platform to address that content, and data related to violations of the terms of service for each platform. Existing law requires the Attorney General to make all terms of service reports submitted pursuant to those provisions available to the public in a searchable repository on its official internet website.
        This bill would add to those categories of content the distribution of controlled substances.
        Existing law, until January 1, 2028, requires a social media platform to create and post a policy statement regarding the use of the social media platform to illegally distribute controlled substances, including a general description of its policies and procedures for responding to law enforcement inquiries. Existing law exempts from these requirements a business that generated less than $100,000,000 in gross revenue during the preceding calendar year.
        This bill would delete the above-described exemption and would require the policy statement to include a general description of the social media platform’s policy on the retention of electronic communication information and policies and procedures governing when a platform proactively shares relevant information pertaining to distribution of a controlled substance, as specified. The bill would require a social media platform to retain content it has taken down or removed for a violation of its policy related to controlled substances, as specified, for a period of 90 days, except when the platform has a good faith belief that the content is related to the offering, seeking, or receiving of gender-affirming health care, gender-affirming mental health care, or reproductive health care that is lawful under California law.

Existing law imposes various requirements on the Attorney General related to consumer protection, including, among others, the supervision of charitable trusts and the enforcement of antitrust laws. Existing law, commonly known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts that are unlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts and prescribes provisions for its enforcement through civil actions.
        This bill, the California Preventing Algorithmic Collusion Act of 2024 (the act), would require a person, as defined, upon request of the Attorney General, to provide to the Attorney General a written report, as specified, on each pricing algorithm, as defined, identified in the request. The act would require that all information submitted in a report under these provisions be treated as confidential and be considered privileged and confidential trade secrets exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act. The act would authorize the Attorney General to share the report with the National Institute of Standards and Technology for technical assistance in understanding the report, as specified.
        This act would prohibit a person from using or distributing any pricing algorithm that uses, incorporates, or was trained with nonpublic competitor data, as defined. If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person has violated these provisions, the act would authorize the Attorney General to bring a civil action against the person in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state, as specified. The act would provide that certain presumptions are established as applicable, including that the defendant entered into a contract in restraint of trade, as specified, if the Attorney General establishes any of specified requirements, including that the defendant distributed the pricing algorithm to 2 or more persons with the intent that the pricing algorithm be used to set or recommend a price, as defined, or commercial term, as defined, of a product or service in the same market or a related market and 2 or more persons used the pricing algorithm to set or recommend a price or commercial term of a product or service.
        This act would require a person that has $5,000,000 or more in annual revenue that uses a pricing algorithm to recommend or set a price or commercial term to make certain disclosures, as specified, including to a customer, before the customer purchases the relevant product or service, that the price or a commercial term is set or recommended by a pricing algorithm. The act would provide that failure to comply with these disclosure provisions constitutes an unfair trade practice, as specified. If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person has violated these disclosure provisions, the act authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action against the person in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state, as specified.
        Existing law establishes the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz), which serves the Governor as the lead entity for economic strategy and the marketing of California on issues relating to business development, private sector investment, and economic growth. Existing law establishes the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation in the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency, headed by the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation. Under existing law, the department has charge of the execution of specified laws relating to various financial institutions and financial services. Existing law requires the commissioner to publish on the department’s internet website an annual report detailing actions taken during the prior year, including, among others, recommendations intended to result in improved oversight, greater transparency, or increased availability of beneficial financial products and services in the marketplace.
        This act would require, on or before January 1, 2027, the office of the Attorney General to publish on its internet website, and notify the Legislature of the publication of, the results of a study conducted in collaboration with GO-Biz and the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation on the use of pricing algorithms using, incorporating, or trained with either or both public and nonpublic data, as specified, including, among other information, the prevalence of pricing algorithms.
        Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

Existing law requires specified actions pertaining to elections to be given precedence when they are filed in court, including actions involving the registration of voters, the certification of candidates and measures, and election contests, and, until January 1, 2027, actions involving the foregoing prohibition against materially deceptive media.

The bill would require a large online platform to label certain additional content inauthentic, fake, or false during specified periods before and after an election in California.
        The bill would require a large online platform to develop procedures for California residents to report content that has not been blocked or labeled in compliance with the act. The bill would also authorize candidates for elected office, elected officials, elections officials, the Attorney General, and a district attorney or city attorney to seek injunctive relief against a large online platform for noncompliance with the act, as specified, and would assign precedence to such actions when they are filed in court.

        This bill would make these provisions inoperative on October 1, 2029, and would repeal them as of January 1, 2030.
        (2) Existing law requires the Geologic Energy Management Division in the Department of Conservation, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, to initiate a study to be conducted by independent experts of fugitive emissions from idle, idle-deserted, and abandoned wells in the state, as provided. Existing law requires oil and gas operators with wells selected for purposes of sampling under these provisions to (1) make reasonable efforts to permit access to the wells to the division and the independent experts contracted to undertake the study if adequate notice is provided to the operator to ensure appropriate safety precautions are taken at the well site, and (2) submit to the division a certification stating that no action was taken to reduce emissions from the sampling site within 72 hours of the sampling taking place so as to reduce the value of measurements taken. A violation of these requirements is a crime. Existing law requires the department, on or before January 1, 2022, to post all results of testing conducted pursuant to the study on the department’s internet website in a machine-readable format. Existing law requires the independent experts contracted to undertake the study, on or before July 1, 2022, to complete a peer-reviewed written document that includes specified elements. Existing law requires the division, on or before January 1, 2023, to make the results of the study, as per the required written document, available on its internet website. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2024.
        This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2029. The bill would change the deadline for the department to post all results of the testing on its internet website from January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2026. The bill would change the deadline for independent experts contracted to undertake the study to complete the written document from July 1, 2022, to July 1, 2026. The bill would change the deadline for the division to make the results of the study available on its internet website from January 1, 2023, to January 1, 2028.

        (3) The Z’berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 prohibits a person from conducting timber operations, as defined, unless a timber harvesting plan prepared by a registered professional forester has been submitted to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The act authorizes the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to exempt from some or all of those provisions of the act a person engaging in specified forest management activities, as prescribed, including the one-time conversion of less than 3 acres to a nontimber use, as specified.
        This bill would authorize the board to adopt regulations for a waiver of the one-time limitation, as specified, including a process for an appeal of a denial of a waiver.
        (4) The Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act covers certain single-use packaging and plastic single-use food service ware, as provided. As part of its comprehensive statutory scheme, the act requires producers of those covered materials to reduce and recycle the covered plastic material and to ensure that covered materials that are offered for sale, distributed, or imported in or into the state on or after January 1, 2032, are recyclable or compostable, as provided. The act prohibits a producer from selling, offering for sale, importing, or distributing covered materials in the state unless the producer is approved to participate in the producer responsibility plan of a producer responsibility organization (PRO), as prescribed, for the source reduction, collection, processing, and recycling of covered material, except as provided. The act requires the producer responsibility plan to include certain information, including, but not limited to, arrangements with processors or recyclers to ensure that covered materials that are not collected through a curbside collection program are collected and recycled at a viable responsible end market.
        This bill would instead require a producer responsibility plan to include arrangements with processors or recyclers to ensure that covered materials that are not collected through a curbside collection program or other local collection program are collected and recycled at a viable responsible end market. The bill would require the producer responsibility plan to include a mechanism and schedule for transferring specified fee proceeds to local jurisdictions. The bill would make technical amendments and other revisions to certain components of the act.
        The act defines “covered material” to include, among others, wraps or wrappers and bags sold to food service establishments.
        This bill would instead include as “covered material” wraps or wrappers and bags used in the packaging of food offered for sale or provided to customers by food service establishments.
        The act requires a PRO, commencing in the 2027 calendar year, and until January 1, 2037, to remit a $500,000,000 surcharge each year, as provided, to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) to be deposited into the California Plastic Pollution Mitigation Fund. The act requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to transmit to the CDTFA by March 1 of each year specified information regarding who is liable for the surcharge and in what amounts. The act requires the surcharge be paid 30 days from the date of CDTFA’s assessment. The act requires a producer that is not in a PRO to pay the surcharge on July 1 of each year.
        This bill would recast the surcharge as the “environmental mitigation surcharge.” The bill would delete the July 1 date for the requirement for a producer not in a PRO to pay the environmental mitigation surcharge. The bill would instead require the CDTFA to mail to each person liable for the environmental mitigation surcharge a notice of determination within 90 days of receiving from the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery the information regarding who is liable for the environmental mitigation surcharge and the amounts to be assessed.
        (5) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 establishes the architectural paint recovery program, under which a manufacturer of architectural paint is required, individually or through a stewardship organization, to submit an architectural paint stewardship plan to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to develop and implement a recovery program to reduce the generation of postconsumer architectural paint, promote the reuse of postconsumer architectural paint, and manage the end of life of postconsumer architectural paint. Existing law excludes from the program aerosol spray paint. Existing law requires a manufacturer of architectural paint or a stewardship organization to submit to the department on or before November 1 of each year a report describing its architectural paint recovery efforts.
        This bill would, among other things, eliminate the exemption from the program of aerosol spray paint and would provide that architectural paint includes aerosol coating products, as defined. The bill would specify that aerosol coating products shall not be regulated under the program until the implementation date of a plan or plan amendment concerning aerosol coating products approved by the department or January 1, 2027, whichever occurs sooner, and would authorize the department to extend that implementation date. The bill would require, on or before July 1, 2026, a manufacturer or stewardship organization to submit an architectural paint stewardship plan or amendment to an approved architectural paint stewardship plan to the department. The bill would change the due date for the annual report to on or before May 15 of each year, would require certain information included in the annual report to be reported based on calendar year, and, commencing with the 2028 report, would require the annual report to include certain information on aerosol coating products. The bill would authorize the department, in coordination with the Department of Toxic Substances Control, to adopt regulations to clarify and implement the architectural paint recovery program.
        (6) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 42041 of the Public Resources Code proposed by SB 303 to be operative only if this bill and SB 303 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.
        (7) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
        This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.",

PPACA defines a “qualified health plan” as a plan that, among other requirements, provides an essential health benefits package. Existing state law creates the California Health Benefit Exchange, also known as Covered California, to facilitate the enrollment of qualified individuals and qualified small employers in qualified health plans as required under PPACA.
        Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, 1975 (Knox-Keene), provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law provides for the MediCal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The MediCal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.
        This bill, the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act, would create the California Guaranteed Health Care for All program, or CalCare, to provide comprehensive universal single-payer health care coverage and a health care cost control system for the benefit of all residents of the state. Under the bill, CalCare would be a health care service plan subject to Knox-Keene. The bill, among other things, would provide that CalCare cover a wide range of medical benefits and other services and would incorporate the health care benefits and standards of other existing federal and state provisions, including the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program, MediCal, ancillary health care or social services covered by regional centers for persons with developmental disabilities, Knox-Keene, and the federal Medicare Program. The bill would make specified persons eligible to enroll as CalCare members during the implementation period, and would provide for automatic enrollment. The bill would require the board to seek all necessary waivers, approvals, and agreements to allow various existing federal health care payments to be paid to CalCare, which would then assume responsibility for all benefits and services previously paid for with those funds.
        This bill would create the CalCare Board to govern CalCare, made up of 9 voting members with demonstrated and acknowledged expertise in health care, and appointed as provided, plus the Secretary of California Health and Human Services or their designee as a nonvoting, ex officio member. The bill would provide the board with all the powers and duties necessary to establish CalCare, including determining when individuals may start enrolling into CalCare, employing necessary staff, negotiating pricing for covered pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, establishing a prescription drug formulary, and negotiating and entering into necessary contracts. The bill would require the board, on or before July 1 of an unspecified year, to conduct and deliver a fiscal analysis to determine whether or not CalCare may be implemented and if revenue is more likely than not to pay for program costs, as specified. The bill would establish an Advisory Commission on Long-Term Services and Supports to advise the board on matters of policy related to long-term services and supports. The bill would require the board to convene a CalCare Public Advisory Committee to advise the board on all matters of policy for CalCare, an Advisory Committee on Public Employees’ Retirement System Health Benefits to provide recommendations related to public employee retiree health benefits, and a CalCare Health Workforce Working Group to provide the board with input on issues related to health care workforce education, recruitment, and retention. The bill would establish an Office of Health Equity within CalCare and under the direction of the Director of the Department of Health Care Access and Information to ensure health equity under the program and other health programs of the California Health and Human Services Agency and to support the board through specified actions.
        This bill would provide for the participation of health care providers in CalCare, including the requirements of a participation agreement between a health care provider and the board, provide for payment for health care items and services, and specify program participation standards. The bill would prohibit a participating provider from discriminating against a person by, among other things, reducing or denying a person’s benefits under CalCare because of a specified characteristic, status, or condition of the person.
        This bill would prohibit a participating provider from billing or entering into a private contract with an individual eligible for CalCare benefits regarding a covered benefit, but would authorize contracting for a health care item or service that is not a covered benefit if specified criteria are met. The bill would authorize health care providers to collectively negotiate fee-for-service rates of payment for health care items and services using a 3rd-party third-party representative, as provided. The bill would require the board to annually determine an institutional provider’s global budget, to be used to cover operating expenses related to covered health care items and services for that fiscal year, and would authorize payments under the global budget.
        This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would develop a revenue plan, taking into consideration anticipated federal revenue available for CalCare. The bill would create the CalCare Trust Fund in the State Treasury, as a continuously appropriated fund, consisting of any federal and state moneys received for the purposes of the act. The bill would specify uses for moneys in the CalCare budget, including special projects for which not-for-profit or governmental entities may apply. Because the bill would create a continuously appropriated fund, it would make an appropriation.
        This bill would prohibit specified provisions of this act from becoming operative until the Secretary of California Health and Human Services gives written notice to the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly that the CalCare Trust Fund has the revenues to fund the costs of implementing the act. The California Health and Human Services Agency would be required to publish a copy of the notice on its internet website.
        Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
